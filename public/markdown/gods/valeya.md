## OVERVIEW

**Valeya, the Light**, is the ever-burning flame that drives away darkness and despair. She is a beacon of hope, compassion, and renewal, worshiped by those who seek to mend the broken and illuminate the path of righteousness. Her radiance is not merely the light of the sun but the warmth of mercy, the glow of wisdom, and the guiding flame that leads the lost home. Where others see the inevitability of suffering, Valeya sees the promise of restoration, for she believes that all wounds—of body, mind, and soul—can be healed with time, care, and the divine light that flows through her.

Valeya's influence extends far beyond the physical realm of light and healing. She is the patron of all those who dedicate their lives to helping others, from humble healers and midwives to powerful clerics and paladins. Her teachings emphasize the importance of compassion, empathy, and the belief that no one is beyond redemption. Valeya's followers are known for their unwavering commitment to helping those in need, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Throughout the history of Edda, Valeya has been a source of comfort and strength during times of great darkness and despair. Her light has guided lost travelers through treacherous paths, healed the wounds of warriors on the battlefield, and brought hope to those who had lost all faith. During the Great War, Valeya's influence was felt in the countless acts of mercy and healing that took place amidst the chaos and destruction, her followers working tirelessly to mend the wounds of both body and spirit.

Valeya's realm in the celestial plane is a place of eternal light and warmth, where the souls of those who have lived lives of compassion and service find their final rest. Here, in the presence of the Light, all pain and suffering are washed away, replaced by a sense of peace and fulfillment. Those who have dedicated their lives to helping others are rewarded with eternal bliss, their spirits shining with the same divine light that guided them in life.

In the mortal realm, Valeya's influence is felt through the countless acts of kindness and healing that take place every day. Her temples are places of refuge and healing, where the sick and injured can find comfort and care. Her symbols, the rising sun and the healing flame, are common motifs in hospitals, clinics, and other places where healing takes place.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Valeya's direct influence has diminished, but her legacy endures through the countless acts of compassion and healing that continue to take place in her name. The healers, clerics, and other caregivers who follow her teachings carry on her work, bringing light and hope to those who need it most.
