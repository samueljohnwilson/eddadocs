## OVERVIEW

**Nogloth, the Ebon Blight**, is a festering pestilence that spreads unseen through the world. He is the god of disease and decay, a force that lingers in the filth of the streets, the rot of the battlefield, and the fevered whispers of the dying. Where others see sickness as an affliction, Nogloth's followers know it as a truth of existence—an inescapable reality that humbles kings and beggars alike. To call upon Nogloth is to invite sickness, to embrace the frailty of flesh, and to acknowledge that in the end, all things succumb.

To many, Nogloth is a force of terror, the harbinger of plague that brings civilizations to their knees. He is there in the first cough of a spreading illness, in the fever that takes hold without warning, in the silent dread of quarantine. His followers tell of the great pestilences of history, of cities emptied by his touch, of rulers begging for his favor only to be swallowed by the very sickness they sought to escape. Unlike other gods of destruction, Nogloth does not bring war or fire—his work is slow and insidious, a death that moves unseen through the air, the water, and the blood of the unknowing.

Yet, there is a grim wisdom to his dominion. To Nogloth, disease is not merely a tool of suffering—it is the great equalizer, a force that does not heed wealth, power, or status. It is through illness that the mighty are brought low, that the arrogance of mortals is stripped away. His most devout followers see sickness as a divine reckoning, a reminder that all are mortal, all are vulnerable, and none can escape the decay that festers beneath the surface. Some whisper that those who accept his will, who do not resist the sickness, are granted glimpses of a deeper truth—a world where flesh is nothing and only spirit remains.

The Plague of Akura was Nogloth's most insidious curse upon the world, a virulent pestilence that swept across the island of [Rajapun](/lands/rajapun) during the Great War and has never truly abated. It began as a fever in the coastal villages, but within days, the afflicted were covered in weeping sores, their flesh blackening and sloughing away as their minds dissolved into fevered delirium. Those who did not perish outright soon turned into shambling husks, bodies still moving while their souls had long since withered. The plague spread relentlessly, carried by the winds and the teeming swarms of insects that hatched from the festering corpses left in its wake. No cure was ever found, and despite the best efforts of healers and priests, the land itself became tainted—every river, every tree, every breath of air steeped in the disease's corruption. Within months, Rajapun was abandoned, its once-thriving cities left to rot beneath a perpetual pall of sickness. To this day, no human who sets foot upon its shores survives for long, as the plague stirs to life at the presence of new victims. Only the dwarves can walk among the ruins without fear, though even they whisper of the shadows that still linger in the miasma, waiting for the return of their master.

For as long as life endures, Nogloth will remain. He does not rage, nor does he gloat—he simply waits. His work is tireless, his reach inescapable. He is the whisper in the lungs, the rot in the blood, the shadow on the healer's face when they know that no remedy will come. His is the patience of plague, the certainty of corruption, and the cold, quiet promise that in time, all things must wither.

## WORSHIPPERS

The followers of Nogloth are a grim and secretive lot, moving unseen through the world like the very plagues they revere. His cultists see disease as a sacred instrument of divine will, spreading sickness in his name to purge the unworthy and hasten the natural decay of civilizations. Other followers include assassins who coat their blades in virulent toxins, delivering slow and agonizing deaths to their victims. These killers are often employed by secretive cabals or vengeful patrons, their work ensuring that even the mightiest rulers can be brought low with a single touch. In war, his disciples move unseen through enemy camps, poisoning wells, tainting food stores, and ensuring that even those untouched by steel fall to a fate far crueler. Their god does not demand blood spilled in battle—only the slow, creeping hand of death, delivered without mercy and without cure.

## VASSALS

Nogloth's plague demons, known as vireth, are grotesque horrors of filth and decay, shambling masses of rotting flesh and seething pestilence. Their bloated, diseased forms constantly ooze black bile, and their breath alone is enough to wither crops and sicken the strong. Wherever they tread, the ground festers, birthing swarms of vermin and clouds of choking miasma. The vireth do not fight with brute strength but with insidious inevitability, their claws festering with infections that no mortal healer can cure. Some take the form of leprous giants, their bodies riddled with gaping sores that spray noxious pus when wounded, while others are little more than writhing colonies of plague-ridden insects, shifting between humanoid and swarming forms as they descend upon their victims. When unleashed upon the mortal world, the vireth are not merely killers—they are living blights, walking pandemics that ensure suffering long after the battle is won.
