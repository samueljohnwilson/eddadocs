## UOVERVIEW

**Thal, the Last Judge**, stands as the epitome of order, objectivity, and reason among the gods of Edda. He is neither swayed by benevolence nor malevolence but remains steadfastly committed to maintaining balance and impartiality. Thal's presence is often depicted as a towering figure clad in armor inscribed with intricate symbols of law and justice, wielding a staff that radiates an aura of calm authority. He is revered by those who seek clarity and fairness in a world often beset by chaos and uncertainty.

Thal's domain encompasses the fundamental principles of order and justice that govern the cosmos. He is the arbiter of disputes, the guardian of balance, and the enforcer of the natural laws that maintain harmony in the universe. His judgments are final and absolute, based not on emotion or personal bias, but on the immutable principles of justice and order. In times of conflict and chaos, Thal's presence brings clarity and resolution, his wisdom cutting through the fog of uncertainty to reveal the path of righteousness.

Throughout the history of Edda, Thal has played a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance between the forces of good and evil, order and chaos. His interventions, though rare, have been decisive in preventing the world from descending into complete anarchy or tyranny. During the Great War, Thal's influence was felt in the establishment of laws and codes of conduct that governed the conduct of both sides, ensuring that even in the midst of conflict, some semblance of order was maintained.

Thal's realm in the celestial plane is a vast hall of judgment, where the souls of the departed are brought before him for final evaluation. Here, in the presence of the Last Judge, all deeds are weighed and measured against the scales of justice. Those who have lived lives of virtue and righteousness are rewarded, while those who have embraced chaos and evil face the consequences of their actions. Thal's judgments are not based on the whims of the moment but on the accumulated weight of a lifetime's choices and actions.

In the mortal realm, Thal's influence is felt through the institutions of law and justice that have been established in his name. Courts, councils, and other bodies of governance often invoke Thal's name in their proceedings, seeking his guidance and wisdom in their deliberations. His symbols, the scales of justice and the sword of judgment, are common motifs in legal institutions and government buildings throughout the lands of Edda.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Thal's direct influence has diminished, but his legacy endures through the laws and principles that he helped establish. The institutions of justice and order that he inspired continue to function, guided by the wisdom and principles that he imparted to mortals. Though he may no longer walk among them, Thal's presence is felt in every court of law, every council chamber, and every place where justice is sought and order is maintained.

## UWORSHIPPERS

Thal's followers are those who value order, justice, and the rule of law above all else. Judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officials often pay homage to the Last Judge, seeking his guidance in their pursuit of justice. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Thal as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Thal's principles of order and justice has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## UVASSALS

The Sentinels are a race of celestial beings that serve as Thal's eyes and ears in the mortal realm. These imposing figures, clad in armor that gleams with divine light, are the embodiment of order and vigilance. They are tasked with observing the affairs of mortals, ensuring that the laws and principles established by Thal are upheld and respected. The Sentinels are not interventionist by nature, preferring to observe and report rather than act directly, but their presence alone is often enough to remind mortals of the importance of order and justice.

The most prominent vassals of Thal are the Storm Heralds, powerful elemental beings that command the winds and rain. These entities serve as intermediaries between Thal and mortals, often appearing during significant weather events to deliver messages or warnings.
