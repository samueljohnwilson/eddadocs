## OVERVIEW

**Surad, the First King**, is the embodiment of leadership, civilization, and the rule of law. As the first of the **Asier** to be created, alongside his brother [Ulat](/gods/ulat), Surad has long been associated with the establishment of order and the foundation of society. His followers believe that he possesses the wisdom and authority to guide mortals toward a more just and prosperous future, and that through his teachings, they can build civilizations that stand the test of time.

In the early days of creation, Surad played a crucial role in guiding mortals toward civilization. He was often depicted as a wise and just ruler, imparting the knowledge of governance and law to those willing to learn. Legends tell of how he taught the first kings and queens the art of leadership, established the first courts of justice, and inspired the first architects and city planners. His influence was instrumental in the development of early civilizations, as his teachings helped shape societies built on the foundations of law, order, and mutual respect.

The Crown of Surad is a legendary artifact said to have been created by the First King himself. This magnificent crown, adorned with precious gems and intricate engravings, is said to possess the power to reveal the true nature of those who wear it. When placed upon the head of a worthy ruler, the crown glows with a divine light, symbolizing the blessing of Surad and the legitimacy of their rule. However, when worn by one who is unworthy or corrupt, the crown becomes heavy and dark, a clear sign of their unsuitability for leadership.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Surad has resided in the celestial plane of Eya. Though his direct influence on the world has diminished, his legacy endures through the institutions of government and the rule of law that he inspired. In Eya, Surad continues to watch over the mortal realm, guiding those who seek his wisdom through dreams, visions, and subtle signs. His presence is felt by those who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of justice and good governance, and his teachings remain a cornerstone of political and legal traditions.

In contemporary times, Surad is venerated by a diverse array of followers, from kings and queens to judges and lawmakers. His symbols, the crown and the scales of justice, are common motifs in courthouses, government buildings, and royal palaces. Festivals dedicated to Surad celebrate the rule of law and the importance of good governance, with ceremonies, parades, and displays of civic pride. Despite the challenges and changes the world has faced, the influence of Surad, the First King, continues to shine as a guiding light for those who seek to build just and prosperous societies.

## WORSHIPPERS

Surad's followers include kings, queens, judges, and all those who seek to establish and maintain order in society. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Surad as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Surad's principles of justice and order has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## VASSALS

Surad's vassals are varied, but they all share a deep connection to the pursuit of justice and the establishment of order. The most notable of his vassals are the celestial knights, divine warriors who serve as the guardians of law and order. These noble beings are said to be the embodiment of Surad's commitment to justice and his desire to protect the innocent from harm. With armor that gleams like starlight and weapons that never dull, the celestial knights are both awe-inspiring and reassuring. Long ago, they would grace the battlefields and courtrooms of the mortal realm, their presence a sign that justice was being served and that the rule of law was being upheld. Judges and rulers believe that the celestial knights possess the ability to see through deception and to discern the truth in even the most complex of cases. Encountering a celestial knight is considered a profound honor, signaling that Surad himself is watching over and bestowing his divine authority upon the fortunate recipient.
