## OVERVIEW

**Ura, the Dawnbringer**, is a deity revered for her creative power, nurturing spirit, and deep connection to fertility, agriculture, and nature. When she first arrived in Edda, she saw a land brimming with potential, a canvas waiting for the brushstrokes of life. With her divine touch, Ura brought forth the mortal races, each uniquely crafted to thrive in the diverse landscapes of Edda.

She created the mighty [trolls](/races/trolls) and towering [jotunn](/races/jotunn), beings of immense strength and resilience, designed to inhabit the harsh mountain ranges and frozen tundras. These races embodied the raw power and endurance needed to survive in the most unforgiving environments, their massive forms and thick hides protecting them from the elements.

For the fertile plains and rolling hills, Ura crafted the [humans](/races/humans), a race of remarkable adaptability and ambition. Humans were given the gift of rapid growth and reproduction, allowing them to quickly populate and dominate the temperate regions of Edda. Their versatility and drive made them natural leaders and innovators, capable of building great civilizations and adapting to changing circumstances.

In the depths of the earth and the heart of the mountains, Ura placed the [dwarves](/races/dwarves), a race of master craftsmen and skilled miners. Dwarves were endowed with an innate understanding of stone and metal, their hands capable of creating works of art and engineering that would endure for generations. Their strong communities and deep connection to the earth made them natural stewards of the underground realms.

For the enchanted forests and mystical groves, Ura created the [elves](/races/elves), a race of ethereal beauty and profound wisdom. Elves were given long lives and a deep connection to magic and nature, allowing them to serve as guardians of the natural world and preservers of ancient knowledge. Their grace and elegance made them natural diplomats and scholars, capable of seeing the beauty in all things.

Finally, for the vast oceans and coastal regions, Ura brought forth the [merfolk](/races/merfolk), a race perfectly adapted to life beneath the waves. Merfolk were given the ability to breathe underwater and navigate the depths with ease, their forms streamlined for swimming and their minds attuned to the rhythms of the sea. They became the guardians of the ocean depths and the masters of maritime trade and exploration.

Ura's influence extends beyond the creation of races to the very essence of life itself. She is the patron of artists, musicians, and creators of all kinds, inspiring them to bring beauty and meaning into the world. Her temples are often adorned with vibrant gardens and works of art, reflecting her love of beauty and creativity. Festivals dedicated to Ura celebrate the arts, fertility, and the renewal of life, with music, dance, and poetry playing central roles in the ceremonies.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Ura's direct influence has diminished, but her legacy endures through the races she created and the beauty they continue to bring into the world. The mortal races of Edda carry within them the spark of Ura's creative spirit, and through their art, music, and culture, they honor the Dawnbringer's vision of a world filled with beauty and wonder.

## WORSHIPPERS

The elven druids, known as the Greenwardens, are devoted followers of Ura, dedicating their lives to preserving the natural world and maintaining the balance between civilization and wilderness.

Their rituals often involve music and dance, reflecting Ura's love of the arts and her connection to the creative spirit.
