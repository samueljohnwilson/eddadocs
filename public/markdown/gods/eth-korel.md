## OVERVIEW

**Eth-Korel, the Duskfall**, is the embodiment of death, disease, and decay. As the third of the **Malor** to be created, alongside his brother [Ura](/gods/ura), Eth-Korel has long been associated with the inevitable end of all things. His followers believe that he possesses the ability to bring death and disease, and that through his teachings, they can understand the nature of mortality and the cycle of life and death. Temples dedicated to Eth-Korel are often built in dark and desolate places, adorned with symbols of death and decay, representing his mastery over the end of life.

In the early days of creation, Eth-Korel played a crucial role in maintaining the balance between life and death. He was often depicted as a dark and mysterious figure, bringing disease and death to those who had lived their lives, and ensuring that nothing lived forever. Legends tell of how he created the first plagues and diseases, shaped the cycle of life and death, and inspired the first healers and undertakers. His influence was instrumental in the development of early civilizations, as his teachings helped shape societies built on the foundations of mortality, respect for the dead, and understanding of the natural cycle.

The Scythe of Eth-Korel is a legendary artifact said to have been created by the Duskfall himself. This dark and twisted scythe, adorned with symbols of death and decay, is said to possess the power to bring death to any living being. When wielded by a worthy wielder, the scythe allows them to end suffering and bring peaceful death to those who are ready to pass. However, when wielded by one who is unworthy or malicious, the scythe becomes a tool of destruction, bringing disease and death to all who come near.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Eth-Korel has resided in the celestial plane of Eya. Though his direct influence on the world has diminished, his legacy endures through the natural cycle of life and death that he inspired. In Eya, Eth-Korel continues to watch over the mortal realm, bringing death and disease to those who have lived their lives through dreams, visions, and subtle signs. His presence is felt by those who dedicate their lives to the understanding of mortality, and his teachings remain a cornerstone of funerary and medical traditions.

In contemporary times, Eth-Korel is venerated by a diverse array of followers, from healers and undertakers to those who seek to understand the nature of death. His symbols, the scythe and the hourglass, are common motifs in hospitals, cemeteries, and other places where death is acknowledged and respected. Festivals dedicated to Eth-Korel celebrate the cycle of life and death and the importance of understanding mortality, with ceremonies, rituals, and displays of funerary customs. Despite the challenges and changes the world has faced, the influence of Eth-Korel, the Duskfall, continues to remind mortals of the inevitable end that awaits all living things.

## WORSHIPPERS

Eth-Korel's followers include healers, undertakers, and all those who seek to understand and respect the cycle of life and death. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Eth-Korel as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Eth-Korel's principles of justice and the natural cycle has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## VASSALS

The reapers are a race of dark spirits that serve as Eth-Korel's most devoted vassals. These ethereal beings are deeply connected to death and the afterlife, their forms taking the shape of hooded figures with scythes. Reapers are the guardians of the dead and the masters of the transition between life and death, protecting the souls of the departed and ensuring that they find their way to the afterlife. They possess the ability to see the thread of life, using their connection to death to maintain the balance between the living and the dead.

The most prominent vassals of Eth-Korel are the Death Heralds, powerful dark beings that command disease and decay. These entities serve as intermediaries between Eth-Korel and mortals, often appearing during significant deaths to deliver messages or warnings.
