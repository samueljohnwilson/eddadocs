## OVERVIEW

Othar, the Red God, is a fierce deity revered and feared for his mastery of war and his embodiment of martial prowess. As one of the **Feymar**, Othar represents the raw power of conflict and the honor that can be found in battle. His followers see him as the patron of warriors, the judge of martial skill, and the bringer of both glory and death. Temples dedicated to Othar are often built in strategic locations—hilltops overlooking battlefields, passes that control trade routes, or near ancient sites of great conflicts—where his power can be felt most strongly.

In the early days of creation, Othar played a crucial role in teaching mortals the arts of war and the codes of honor that govern conflict. He is said to have taught the first warriors how to fight with skill and courage, how to lead armies into battle, and how to find honor even in the midst of bloodshed. His teachings emphasized that war was not merely about killing, but about testing one's strength, protecting what one values, and proving one's worth through courage and skill. Othar's influence is felt in every battle that tests the mettle of warriors, every victory that brings glory, and every defeat that teaches humility.

The Blood Fields of Othar are legendary battlefields where his presence is said to be strongest. These hallowed grounds are marked by ancient weapons embedded in the earth, memorials to fallen warriors, and altars where warriors make offerings before battle. Warriors and commanders make pilgrimages to these fields to seek Othar's blessing and to honor the memory of those who have fallen in battle. The fields are tended by the Red Guard, an order of warriors and strategists who have dedicated their lives to Othar's service. Visitors to the Blood Fields often find themselves blessed with extraordinary martial skill and the ability to inspire courage in others.

Since the Godsdeath, when [[Anoreth]] banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Othar's influence has become more subtle but no less important. Though he no longer walks openly among mortals, his presence is felt in every battle that rages across the land, in every warrior who fights with honor, and in every victory that brings glory to the worthy. His followers believe that Othar continues to test warriors with the challenges of battle, blessing those who fight with skill and honor and punishing those who bring dishonor to the art of war.

In contemporary times, Othar is venerated by warriors, soldiers, and all who must face the challenges of conflict. His symbols—the blood-red sword, the warrior's shield, the battle standard, and the horn of war—are common in military camps, training grounds, and places where warriors gather throughout Edda. Festivals dedicated to Othar celebrate martial skill, honor in battle, and the memory of fallen heroes. Despite the passage of time and the changes in the world, Othar's fierce spirit continues to inspire those who must face the trials of war.

## UWORSHIPPERS

Othar's followers include warriors, soldiers, and all who must face the challenges of conflict. They are the ones who fight with honor and skill, protecting their people and testing their mettle in battle. The military camps and warrior communities of Edda are home to many of Othar's most devoted followers.

In the military camps and warrior communities of Edda, the Red Guard, an order of warriors and strategists, dedicate their lives to the worship and teachings of the Red God. These skilled individuals are renowned for their martial abilities, their strategic thinking, and their unwavering commitment to honor in battle. They live in communities centered around training grounds, military academies, and warrior halls, where they teach others the arts of war and the codes of honor. The Red Guard are particularly known for their ability to inspire courage in others and to call upon Othar's blessing for victory in battle. They travel throughout the land, offering their services as trainers and strategists and helping to maintain the traditions of honorable warfare.

## UVASSALS

Othar's vassals are creatures of war and battle, embodying his fierce and honorable nature.

The most notable of his vassals are the bloodkin, warrior spirits that take the form of spectral warriors—armored figures with weapons that glow with inner fire, their eyes burning with the light of battle. These powerful creatures are deeply connected to the worship of Othar and are said to be his most beloved servants. Bloodkin are rarely seen by mortals, appearing only to those who are engaged in honorable battle or who have earned Othar's favor. They are known to inspire courage in warriors, to guide armies to victory, and to test the skill and honor of those who would master the art of war. A place blessed by a bloodkin is said to be protected from dishonorable attacks, where warriors find strength and victory comes to the worthy. Encountering a bloodkin is considered both a blessing and a test, signaling that Othar himself has taken an interest in the martial prowess of the fortunate recipient.
