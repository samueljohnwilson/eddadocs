## UOVERVIEW

Po, the Tempest, is a deity of chaos and unpredictability. She is a force of wild energy, embodying the ever-changing and capricious nature of the cosmos. Po is often depicted wreathed in swirling winds and crackling lightning, her laughter echoing across the skies like thunder. She holds sway over the turbulent forces of nature, her whims shaping the winds, rains, and storms that sweep across the mortal realm. She delights in stirring up chaos, reveling in unpredictability and the raw power of the elements.

Po's influence extends far beyond the simple act of creating storms and weather patterns. She is the patron of all those who embrace change and uncertainty, from sailors and explorers to artists and adventurers. Her teachings emphasize the importance of adaptability, creativity, and the beauty that can be found in chaos and disorder. Po's followers are known for their free spirits, their love of adventure, and their ability to find opportunity in the midst of chaos.

Throughout the history of Edda, Po has been a source of both destruction and renewal. Her storms have devastated coastlines and destroyed crops, but they have also brought life-giving rain to parched lands and cleared away the old to make way for the new. During the Great War, Po's influence was felt in the countless acts of courage and adaptability that took place amidst the chaos and destruction, her followers working tirelessly to survive and thrive in the face of overwhelming odds.

Po's realm in the celestial plane is a place of eternal change and transformation, where the souls of those who have lived lives of adventure and adaptability find their final rest. Here, in the presence of the Tempest, all stagnation and rigidity are swept away, replaced by a sense of freedom and possibility. Those who have dedicated their lives to embracing change and uncertainty are rewarded with eternal adventure, their spirits carried on the winds of possibility.

In the mortal realm, Po's influence is felt through the countless acts of courage and adaptability that take place every day. Her temples are places of refuge and renewal, where those seeking change can find guidance and inspiration. Her symbols, the lightning bolt and the storm cloud, are common motifs in places where change and transformation take place.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Po's direct influence has diminished, but her legacy endures through the countless acts of courage and adaptability that continue to take place in her name. The sailors, explorers, and other adventurers who follow her teachings carry on her work, embracing change and finding opportunity in chaos.

## UWORSHIPPERS

Po's followers are those who dedicate their lives to embracing change and uncertainty, and to finding opportunity in chaos. Sailors, explorers, and adventurers often pay homage to the Tempest, seeking her guidance in their work of navigating the unknown and adapting to changing circumstances. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Po as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Po's principles of adaptability and justice has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## UVASSALS

The skremlings are a race of small, mischievous creatures that serve as Po's most devoted vassals. These diminutive beings are deeply connected to the chaotic forces of nature, their forms taking the shape of small, humanoid creatures with wild hair and unpredictable behavior. Skremlings are the agents of change and transformation, using their connection to chaos to bring about unexpected events and opportunities. They possess the ability to manipulate weather patterns and create minor storms, using their powers to help or hinder mortals as their whims dictate.

The most prominent vassals of Po are the Storm Heralds, powerful elemental beings that command the winds and rain. These entities serve as intermediaries between Po and mortals, often appearing during significant weather events to deliver messages or warnings.
