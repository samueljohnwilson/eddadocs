## OVERVIEW

**Malak, the Lord of Lies**, is the embodiment of deception, chaos, and destruction. As the second of the **Malor** to be created, alongside his brother [Agorus](/gods/agorus), Malak has long been associated with the darker aspects of existence. His followers believe that he possesses the ability to manipulate truth and reality, and that through his teachings, they can achieve power and dominance over others. Temples dedicated to Malak are shrouded in darkness and secrecy, adorned with symbols of shadows and twisted mirrors, representing his mastery of illusion and deception.

In the early days of creation, Malak played a crucial role in testing the resolve and wisdom of mortals. He was often depicted as a cunning and manipulative figure, tempting mortals with false promises and leading them astray with lies and illusions. Legends tell of how he corrupted the first kings and queens with promises of unlimited power, deceived the first scholars with false knowledge, and inspired the first criminals and assassins. His influence was instrumental in the development of early civilizations, as his teachings helped shape societies built on the foundations of fear, mistrust, and corruption.

The Mirror of Malak is a legendary artifact said to have been created by the Lord of Lies himself. This twisted mirror, adorned with dark runes and shadowy engravings, is said to possess the power to reveal the hidden desires and darkest secrets of those who gaze into it. When looked upon by a pure and virtuous soul, the mirror shows only their reflection, unchanged and untainted. However, when gazed upon by one who harbors dark thoughts or hidden desires, the mirror reveals their true nature, often driving them to madness or corruption.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Malak has resided in the celestial plane of Eya. Though his direct influence on the world has diminished, his legacy endures through the institutions of deception and corruption that he inspired. In Eya, Malak continues to watch over the mortal realm, tempting those who seek his power through dreams, visions, and subtle signs. His presence is felt by those who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of power and domination, and his teachings remain a cornerstone of criminal and corrupt traditions.

In contemporary times, Malak is venerated by a diverse array of followers, from thieves and assassins to corrupt politicians and power-hungry warlords. His symbols, the shadow and the twisted mirror, are common motifs in criminal hideouts, corrupt courts, and other places where deception and corruption thrive. Festivals dedicated to Malak celebrate the power of deception and the importance of cunning, with ceremonies, rituals, and displays of dark magic. Despite the challenges and changes the world has faced, the influence of Malak, the Lord of Lies, continues to cast a shadow over those who seek power through deception and corruption.

## WORSHIPPERS

Malak's followers include thieves, assassins, and all those who seek to gain power through deception and corruption. In the realm of [Jutlund](/lands/jutlund), the Jut people hold Malak in particularly high regard, seeing him as the source of their cunning and their ability to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. The Jut assassins, known as the Shadow Walkers, are devoted followers of Malak, dedicating their lives to mastering the art of deception and the taking of life.

The Shadow Walkers are renowned for their ability to move unseen and unheard, their skills in stealth and assassination unmatched by any other order. They serve as the enforcers of Jut law and the protectors of their people, ensuring that those who threaten the Jut way of life are dealt with swiftly and silently. Their rituals often involve the use of shadows and illusions, reflecting Malak's love of deception and his connection to the darker aspects of existence.

## VASSALS

The shadows are a race of dark spirits that serve as Malak's most devoted vassals. These ethereal beings are deeply connected to the darkness and shadows of Edda, their forms taking the shape of shifting shadows and dark mist. Shadows are the guardians of the night and the masters of deception, protecting the secrets and hidden knowledge that serve as Malak's sacred places. They possess the ability to move unseen and unheard, using their connection to darkness to maintain the balance between light and shadow.

The most prominent vassals of Malak are the Shadow Heralds, powerful dark beings that command the shadows and illusions. These entities serve as intermediaries between Malak and mortals, often appearing during significant events to deliver messages or warnings.
