## OVERVIEW

**Bayah, the Everstorm**, is the embodiment of nature's raw power and untamed fury. As the fourth of the **Malor** to be created, alongside his brother [Thal](/gods/thal), Bayah has long been associated with the chaotic and unpredictable forces of nature. His followers believe that he possesses the ability to command the elements and unleash devastating storms, and that through his teachings, they can harness the power of nature for their own purposes. Temples dedicated to Bayah are often built in remote and dangerous locations, adorned with symbols of lightning and wind, representing his mastery over the elements.

In the early days of creation, Bayah played a crucial role in shaping the natural world and testing the resilience of mortals. He was often depicted as a wild and unpredictable figure, unleashing storms and natural disasters to challenge those who sought to tame the wilderness. Legends tell of how he created the first hurricanes and tornadoes, shaped the mountains with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and inspired the first explorers and adventurers. His influence was instrumental in the development of early civilizations, as his teachings helped shape societies built on the foundations of adaptability, resilience, and respect for nature.

The Storm Crown is a legendary artifact said to have been created by the Everstorm himself. This magnificent crown, adorned with lightning bolts and storm clouds, is said to possess the power to control the weather and command the elements. When worn by a worthy wielder, the crown allows them to summon storms, control the wind, and harness the power of lightning. However, when worn by one who is unworthy or unprepared, the crown becomes a source of chaos and destruction, unleashing uncontrollable storms that devastate the land.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Bayah has resided in the celestial plane of Eya. Though his direct influence on the world has diminished, his legacy endures through the natural forces and weather patterns that he inspired. In Eya, Bayah continues to watch over the mortal realm, unleashing storms and natural disasters to challenge those who seek his power through dreams, visions, and subtle signs. His presence is felt by those who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of adventure and exploration, and his teachings remain a cornerstone of survival and wilderness traditions.

In contemporary times, Bayah is venerated by a diverse array of followers, from sailors and explorers to druids and nature worshippers. His symbols, the lightning bolt and the storm cloud, are common motifs in weather stations, coastal communities, and other places where the power of nature is respected and feared. Festivals dedicated to Bayah celebrate the power of nature and the importance of resilience, with ceremonies, rituals, and displays of weather magic. Despite the challenges and changes the world has faced, the influence of Bayah, the Everstorm, continues to rage across the lands, reminding mortals of the awesome power of nature.

## WORSHIPPERS

Bayah's followers include sailors, explorers, and all those who seek to understand and harness the power of nature. In the realm of [Jutlund](/lands/jutlund), the Jut people hold Bayah in particularly high regard, seeing him as the source of their resilience and their ability to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. The Jut stormcallers, known as the Wind Speakers, are devoted followers of Bayah, dedicating their lives to understanding and predicting the weather.

The Wind Speakers are renowned for their ability to read the signs of nature and predict coming storms, their knowledge of weather patterns unmatched by any other order. They serve as the protectors of their people, ensuring that they are prepared for the storms and natural disasters that Bayah sends to test their resilience. Their rituals often involve the use of wind and weather, reflecting Bayah's love of storms and his connection to the chaotic forces of nature.

## VASSALS

The storm spirits are a race of elemental beings that serve as Bayah's most devoted vassals. These ethereal creatures are deeply connected to the weather and storms of Edda, their forms taking the shape of swirling winds and crackling lightning. Storm spirits are the guardians of the skies and the masters of weather, protecting the natural forces and weather patterns that serve as Bayah's sacred places. They possess the ability to control the wind and rain, using their connection to nature to maintain the balance between calm and storm.

The most prominent vassals of Bayah are the Storm Heralds, powerful elemental beings that command the winds and rain. These entities serve as intermediaries between Bayah and mortals, often appearing during significant weather events to deliver messages or warnings.

Brounies are the most well-known servants of Bayahâ€”small, unseen fey that dwell in homes, barns, and fields, contributing the smooth running of daily life. Brounies are exceptionally rare, and those lucky enough to be visited by a brouny would do well to show their gratitude. They are said to be no taller than a child, with wiry frames and eyes that gleam like embers in the hearth. Ever industrious, brounies sweep floors, mend broken tools, churn butter, and chase away pests from the grain stores. They show their favour to those who keep a clean home and work diligently, but will abandon any who grow slothful or ungrateful. Tradition holds that leaving a fresh loaf of bread, a bowl of milk, or a warm blanket by the fire will earn a brouny's favor. Though mischievous at times, especially to the lazy, the brounies are ultimately benevolent beings, ensuring that hearths remain warm, larders full, and the harvest plentiful in Bayah's name.
