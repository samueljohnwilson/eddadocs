## OVERVIEW

**Bayah, the Hearthkeeper**, is the gentle yet steadfast guardian of home and hearth. She is revered by farmers, herdsmen, and all who cultivate the land or tend to the warmth of the home. She represents not only the bounty of the fields but also the bonds of kinship, the comfort of a well-tended fire, and the strength found in community. Though she is a nurturing deity, providing for those who toil with honest labor, she does not abide laziness or waste. The gifts of the earth are meant to be earned and cherished, and those who take more than their share risk falling out of her favor.

Unlike wilder gods who embody the untamed aspects of nature, Bayah values careful stewardship above all. She teaches that the land, though bountiful, must be nurtured and respected, lest it withhold its riches. She is the patron of those who plant and reap, who tend animals, and who sustain their families through patience and diligence. The first fruits of every harvest are often offered to her in gratitude, a recognition that prosperity is never guaranteed without the cooperation of soil, rain, and toil.

The Hearthkeeper's influence extends beyond the fields and into the home. She is invoked over the first fire in a new dwelling, and many households maintain small altars to her, adorned with fresh bread, dried herbs, or simple tokens of gratitude. She watches over families, ensuring that love and warmth endure even in the harshest of times. Though she does not meddle in mortal disputes, those who violate the sanctity of home and family—through treachery, greed, or cruelty—may find their fortunes withering like an untended crop.

Though kind, Bayah is not weak. She is as firm as the plow cutting through earth, as enduring as the ancient traditions passed down through generations. In times of famine or hardship, her followers pray for her mercy, and she answers those who have been faithful stewards of the land. But when communities turn against one another, hoard grain while others starve, or defile the sanctity of hearth and home, she withholds her blessings, letting them reap the consequences of their own selfishness.

During the Great War, Bayah's blessings became the lifeblood of the armies of righteousness, sustaining them in their darkest hours. As battlefields burned and farmlands were trampled under the weight of war, it was the Hearthkeeper's touch that ensured the harvest did not fail entirely, that grain stores held longer than they should, and that the bread in soldiers' packs remained unblemished by mold. In besieged cities, where starvation loomed, prayers to Bayah saw roots and wild herbs flourish in hidden places, and livestock bear young despite the strain of war. Her faithful worked tirelessly, harvesting, baking, and tending to the wounded, their simple acts of nurture proving as vital as any blade or spell. Though she did not wield the storm or the sword, Bayah's quiet strength endured, ensuring that those who stood against darkness did not falter from hunger or despair.

Her festivals revolve around planting and harvest, marked by feasts where communities gather to share in the bounty of their work. It is said that those who open their tables to the hungry on these days are blessed with good fortune, while those who turn others away may find their stores spoiled or their livestock barren in the seasons to come.

## WORSHIPPERS

Bayah's followers are many, ranging from humble farmers to skilled artisans who work with the fruits of the land—millers, brewers, cheesemakers, and potters. Even rulers and warlords respect her, for no kingdom can stand without sustenance. Her clergy often oversee communal feasts, preaching the values of diligence, charity, and the unbreakable bond between land and people.

The Hearthkeeper's influence is particularly strong in agricultural communities throughout Edda, where her teachings about stewardship and community have shaped the way people live and work together. Her followers believe that the land is a gift that must be cared for with respect and gratitude, and they work to ensure that their communities thrive through cooperation and mutual support.

## VASSALS

Brounies are the most well-known servants of Bayah—small, unseen fey that dwell in homes, barns, and fields, contributing to the smooth running of daily life. Brounies are exceptionally rare, and those lucky enough to be visited by a brouny would do well to show their gratitude. They are said to be no taller than a child, with wiry frames and eyes that gleam like embers in the hearth.

Ever industrious, brounies sweep floors, mend broken tools, churn butter, and chase away pests from the grain stores. They show their favor to those who keep a clean home and work diligently, but will abandon any who grow slothful or ungrateful. Tradition holds that leaving a fresh loaf of bread, a bowl of milk, or a warm blanket by the fire will earn a brouny's favor. Though mischievous at times, especially to the lazy, the brounies are ultimately benevolent beings, ensuring that hearths remain warm, larders full, and the harvest plentiful in Bayah's name.

The brounies serve as Bayah's eyes and hands in the mortal world, watching over families and communities to ensure that the values of hard work, gratitude, and community are upheld. They are particularly active during times of hardship, when their quiet assistance can make the difference between survival and despair.
