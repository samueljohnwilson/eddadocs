## OVERVIEW

**Dosha, the Gilded Hand**, is the god of wealth, commerce, and prosperity. He is the patron of merchants, bankers, and those who seek fortune through trade and cunning. His domain is not merely gold and riches, but the flow of goods, the balance of agreements, and the trust that sustains economic exchange. Trade is the foundation upon which societies rise and fall, and Dosha ensures that this great engine continues to turn. Where markets thrive, where caravans cross vast distances, where contracts are honored and fortunes are made, there Dosha's influence is felt.

Dosha's influence extends far beyond the simple accumulation of wealth. He is the patron of all those who engage in honest trade and commerce, from humble street vendors to powerful merchant princes. His teachings emphasize the importance of fair dealing, mutual benefit, and the role that commerce plays in building and sustaining civilizations. Dosha's followers are known for their business acumen, their commitment to fair trade, and their understanding of the complex web of relationships that make up the economic fabric of society.

Throughout the history of Edda, Dosha has been a driving force behind the development of civilization and culture. His wisdom has guided the establishment of trade routes and marketplaces, his influence has fostered the growth of cities and nations, and his principles have helped to create the complex economic systems that sustain modern society. During the Great War, Dosha's influence was felt in the countless acts of generosity and mutual aid that took place amidst the chaos and destruction, his followers working tirelessly to maintain the flow of goods and services that kept communities alive.

Dosha's realm in the celestial plane is a place of eternal abundance and prosperity, where the souls of those who have lived lives of honest commerce and fair dealing find their final rest. Here, in the presence of the Merchant Lord, all want and need are satisfied, replaced by a sense of fulfillment and abundance. Those who have dedicated their lives to creating wealth and prosperity for others are rewarded with eternal comfort, their spirits enriched by the same abundance they provided in life.

In the mortal realm, Dosha's influence is felt through the countless acts of trade and commerce that take place every day. His temples are places of business and negotiation, where merchants can make deals and contracts can be sealed. His symbols, the golden coin and the merchant's scale, are common motifs in marketplaces, banks, and other places where wealth is created and exchanged.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Dosha's direct influence has diminished, but his legacy endures through the countless acts of trade and commerce that continue to take place in his name. The merchants, bankers, and other businesspeople who follow his teachings carry on his work, creating wealth and prosperity for all.

## WORSHIPPERS

Dosha's followers are those who dedicate their lives to creating wealth and prosperity through honest trade and commerce. Merchants, bankers, and businesspeople often pay homage to the Merchant Lord, seeking his guidance in their work of building and sustaining economic systems. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Dosha as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Dosha's principles of fair dealing and justice has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## VASSALS

The **grey scribes** are Dosha's tireless record-keepers, divine beings tasked with maintaining the Ledger—a vast and unfathomable record of all debts, transactions, and agreements made across the planes. They exist in the liminal space between law and fortune, their forms draped in spectral grey robes that shift like parchment in the wind. Each carries a parchment tome and stylus, with which they inscribe every contract, oath, and exchange into celestial tomes that are said to be kept in the Vault of Accounts, a grand hall within Dosha's domain. Silent and impartial, the scribes do not judge the morality of a transaction—only that it is recorded truthfully and whether all parties uphold their end of the bargain. They are privy to all manner of pacts, hearing them as whispers from across the planes. It is said that those who attempt to cheat Dosha's order—whether through fraud, broken contracts, or the refusal to settle debts—will find themselves silently judged by the scribes. The most grievous offenders, those who undermine the very fabric of trade, may see their names struck from the Ledger, an erasure that marks them as cursed, ensuring that fortune will never again smile upon their dealings.
