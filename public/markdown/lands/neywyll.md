## OVERVIEW

Neywyll, known as the Young Forest, is the sacred homeland of the Neydan elves, a mysterious and deeply forested realm that stands as a testament to the resilience and determination of the elven people. After their exile from Ulwyll during the War of the Schism, the elves who were blessed by the Eyar settled in this western forest, creating a new sanctuary that would become their permanent home. Unlike their Albian kin who sought to preserve the ancient ways of Ulwyll, the Neydan elves have embraced their new homeland with a fierce devotion, developing a culture that is both deeply traditional and uniquely adapted to their forest environment.

The Neydan elves are known for their deep connection to the natural world and their fierce independence. They have maintained their isolation from the wider world, preferring to live in harmony with the forest that shelters them. Their society is built around the principles of balance, sustainability, and respect for the natural order, with every aspect of their culture reflecting their reverence for the land they call home.

## GEOGRAPHY

Neywyll is characterized by its vast, ancient forests that stretch as far as the eye can see. The trees here are massive and ancient, their canopies forming a dense green roof that filters the sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. The terrain is varied, with rolling hills, deep valleys, and clear streams that wind their way through the woodland. The forest is home to a rich diversity of plant and animal life, with many species found nowhere else in Edda.

The climate is temperate, with mild summers and cool winters that are moderated by the forest canopy. The elves have learned to work with the natural rhythms of the seasons, adapting their way of life to the cycles of growth and dormancy that govern the forest. The land is rich in natural resources, providing the elves with everything they need to sustain their civilization without exploiting the environment.

## PEOPLE AND CULTURE

The Neydan elves are a proud and independent people who have maintained their cultural identity despite the challenges they have faced. They are deeply spiritual, with a religion that centers around their connection to the natural world and their reverence for the ancient traditions of their ancestors. Unlike the Albian elves who have embraced modernity and arcane magic, the Neydan have remained true to the ancient ways, focusing on living in harmony with nature rather than seeking to dominate it.

The elves of Neywyll are master craftsmen, particularly in the areas of woodworking, textiles, and herbalism. They have developed sophisticated techniques for working with the natural materials of their forest home, creating beautiful and functional items that reflect their artistic sensibilities and practical needs. Their settlements are designed to blend seamlessly with the natural landscape, with buildings that seem to grow from the forest itself rather than being imposed upon it.

## GOVERNANCE

Neywyll is governed by a council of elders who are chosen for their wisdom, experience, and deep connection to the land. These leaders make decisions through consensus, ensuring that all voices are heard and that the needs of both the people and the forest are considered. The council is advised by spiritual leaders who interpret the will of the natural world and ensure that the elves remain in harmony with their environment.

The governance of Neywyll is decentralized, with individual communities having a great deal of autonomy while still maintaining connections to the larger society. This structure allows the elves to adapt to local conditions while preserving their shared cultural identity and values.

## RELATIONS WITH OTHER LANDS

The Neydan elves have historically maintained minimal contact with the outside world, preferring to focus on their own affairs and the preservation of their way of life. However, they have not been completely isolated. Prior to the Great War, they had close ties with the Wydish people of Wydmyn, sharing knowledge and cultural traditions in a relationship built on mutual respect and cooperation.

The Great War and the subsequent betrayal by some of the Wydish shattered this relationship, leading the elves to become even more insular and wary of outsiders. Today, they maintain only limited contact with the outside world, primarily through the Wydish who have remained loyal to their ancient bonds and continue to patrol the borders of Neywyll.

## RELIGION

The religious practices of the Neydan elves are deeply rooted in their connection to the natural world and their reverence for their ancestors. They worship [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth), the creator of the elves, and maintain many of the ancient rituals and traditions that were practiced in Ulwyll. However, their worship has evolved to reflect their new home and their relationship with the forest that shelters them.

The elves believe that the forest itself is sacred, a living entity that provides for their needs and protects them from the outside world. They perform rituals to honor the cycles of nature, celebrate the changing seasons, and maintain the balance between themselves and their environment. Their spiritual leaders, known as druids, serve as intermediaries between the people and the natural world, interpreting omens and ensuring that the elves remain in harmony with their surroundings.

## THE GREAT WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH

The Great War had a profound impact on Neywyll and its people. When the conflict broke out, the elves fought alongside their allies, including the dwarves and the loyal Wydish. However, the betrayal by some of the Wydish during the Battle of Twelve Kings resulted in catastrophic losses for the Neydan elves and marked a turning point in their relationship with the outside world.

In the aftermath of the war, the elves became even more insular, focusing on rebuilding their society and strengthening their connection to their forest home. They have since maintained their isolation, preferring to let the outside world pass them by while they preserve their ancient traditions and way of life.

## CURRENT STATUS

Today, Neywyll remains a mysterious and largely unknown land to the outside world. The elves continue to live their traditional way of life, maintaining their deep connection to the forest and their ancient cultural practices. They are protected by the loyal Wydish who patrol their borders, ensuring that their isolation is maintained and their way of life is preserved.

The Neydan elves have no desire to expand their influence or engage with the wider world. They are content to live in harmony with their forest home, preserving the ancient traditions of their ancestors and maintaining the balance that has sustained them for generations. To them, the forest of Neywyll is not just their home—it is their sanctuary, their protector, and their connection to the ancient wisdom of their people.
