## OVERVIEW

Hetheskein is the domain of the dwarves and they have been its sole inhabitants since the Second Age. It takes its name from Hethe, the enormous volcanic mountain that dominates the landscape; the great majority of the dwarven population lives within the mountain and the capital city, Hethedun, sits at its peak. Apart from the population within Hethe, the mountain dwarves also maintain outposts in other mountains across Hetheskein.

The dwarves that inhabit the tundra and valleys are distinct from those that dwell in Hethe; they are a loose confederation of tribes, bound together by their common religious heritage. They are nomadic, with no cities to speak of. They maintain civil, if occasionally tense, relations with their mountain dwarf kin.

## CAPITAL

**Hethedun** is a citadel that houses the throne of the dwarf king. It is the political, cultural, and economic capital of the mountain kingdom. The dwarven religion venerates Othar and his worship centres around a great forge that is housed here.

## LAW ENFORCEMENT

In Hethe, the law is enforced by the Ironskins, the military arm of the Otharic religious order. However, the rigid morality of mountain dwarf society means that there is rarely a need for the Ironskins to exercise their authority, so their day-to-day role is primarily ceremonial.

In the tundra, each tribe has their own way of dealing with criminals, though in broad terms, their view of law is based on honour and eye-for-an-eye retributive justice.

## HISTORY

Following the diaspora of the Illyum, the uruk made landing in the region that would become Bjordlund. They began to venture further north into what would be Hetheskein. At the dawn of the Second Age, when Eos created the other races, she awakened the dwarves in the caverns around Mount Hethe. Before long, the orcs and dwarves came into conflict, and a deep hatred would grow between the races over the millennia. When the War of All Lands finally came to pass, the uruk and dwarves fought some of the bloodiest battles of the war. Even to this day, across the icy tundra or high in the mountains, it is not unheard of to find remains of the ancient battles, mummified by the frigid climate of the north. At the end of the war, the uruk were driven out of Hetheskein once and for all, as the forces of righteousness prevailed across the land. Since then, the dwarves have held sole claim to the land.
