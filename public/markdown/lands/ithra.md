## OVERVIEW

**Government:** Elected council  
**Population:** 1.2 million  
**Ethnicities:** Ayman, many others

Ithra was once the most powerful and wealthy nation in Edda, but all that now remains of the former empire is the city-state of Amin. The rest of the country is sparsely populated, typically by nomadic tribes. Ithra has two distinct regions: the Qadish desert that stretches east from the border with Garrad, and a tropical rainforest island on its eastern coast known as Rajapun.

## CAPITAL

The city-state of **Amin** is all that remains of Ithra. It is situated on the tip of the Qadish Peninsula. Few travellers visit the isolated city by land, but the Aminites maintain trade relationships with Unterlund and Garrad by ship. Amin was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city before the war, and its population and diversity was only bolstered by refugees from the rest of Ithra. Today, the bustling markets and vast libraries of Amin are renowned across Edda.

## GOVERNANCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

The body that governs Amin is known as the Ku'rash. It is composed of 151 representatives from across the city. While the positions are elected democratically, most of those that hold them are exceptionally wealthy and influential, making them likely to remain in power once elected.

The law enforcement arm of the Ku'rash are known as the Tomesguard. Appointment to the guard is for life and it is a highly sought after position, especially for young men from the slums. Once a year, the Ku'rash hold a week-long festival of gladiatorial battles to fill vacancies among the Tomesguard.

## HISTORY

In the past, the Qadish desert was dotted with city-states similar to Amin, but they fell during the War of All Lands and were never re-established. Now, the region is only sparsely populated with small tribes of nomads, with the exception of Amin. The ruins of the great cities are largely covered by the dunes and forgotten, but there are some that speak of ancient wealth and treasures buried deep within the red sand.

Before the war, the dense jungle of Rajapun was also home to a thriving network of city-states. However, they refused the call to face the forces of darkness head on, choosing instead to fortify their cities and wait for the Malor to march against them. While they awaited the coming darkness, a great sickness swept the land. Known at the Plague of Akura, the illness affected the minds of those it afflicted, causing them to fall into madness before eventually succumbing to death. The plague brought the nation to collapse from within without the dark lords ever waging war upon it. The jungle has now reclaimed the ancient cities, and it is believed that men no longer dwell in Rajapun. Those adventurous souls that have sought out the ancient cities are rarely heard from again; those few that have returned are not the same as when they set out.

## CULTURE

The people of Amin are very cultured compared to the rest of the world. They are much more likely to be literate than people in other parts of the world and the use of magic, though still rare, is not viewed with suspicion and fear, but interest and wonder. The culture is largely based on trade with other nations and Ithrans are likely to drive a hard bargain as a result. The largest ethnic group in the city is the Ayman, but the city is exceptionally diverse and home to ethnicities from all over Edda.

## RELIGION

The state religion is devoted to Eos, where she is recognized as patron of knowledge, and she is worshipped by many in the city. However, there are sects devoted to each of the Ishtar in Amin, and in the darker corners of the city, likely even cults devoted to the Malor.
