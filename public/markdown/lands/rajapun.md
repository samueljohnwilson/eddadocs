## OVERVIEW

Rajapun is a mysterious island that was once home to a thriving population of humans, but now serves as a haunting reminder of the devastating plague that swept through the land in the lead-up to the Great War. The island's dense jungles now conceal the ruins of what were once bustling cities and prosperous communities, with only the dwarves remaining as permanent inhabitants, seemingly immune to the curse that claimed so many human lives.

The island's history is marked by tragedy and mystery, with the Plague of Akura serving as a turning point that transformed Rajapun from a center of human civilization into a place of legend and fear. Today, the island is largely avoided by outsiders, though some brave or desperate souls still venture into its depths in search of the ancient treasures and knowledge that may still lie hidden among the ruins.

## GEOGRAPHY

Rajapun is characterized by its dense tropical rainforest, which has grown to cover much of the island since the decline of human civilization. The jungle is incredibly thick and difficult to navigate, with towering trees that block out much of the sunlight and create a perpetual twilight beneath their canopy. The island's terrain is varied, with rolling hills, deep valleys, and occasional clearings where the ruins of ancient settlements can still be found.

The climate is hot and humid, with frequent rainfall that helps sustain the lush vegetation. The island is surrounded by treacherous waters, with dangerous reefs and unpredictable currents that make maritime access challenging. The natural resources of the island include exotic woods, rare plants, and mineral deposits that were once extensively exploited by the human inhabitants.

## HISTORY

Before the Great War, Rajapun was home to a sophisticated network of city-states that rivaled the greatest cities of Edda in terms of wealth, culture, and technological advancement. The human inhabitants had developed advanced agricultural techniques, impressive architectural achievements, and a rich cultural tradition that was the envy of many other nations.

However, when the call went out for all nations to unite against the forces of darkness, the rulers of Rajapun chose to remain neutral, believing that their isolation would protect them from the coming conflict. Instead of joining the fight, they fortified their cities and prepared to wait out the storm. This decision would prove to be their undoing.

As they awaited the arrival of the Malor, a terrible sickness known as the Plague of Akura began to spread through the human population. The disease affected the minds of those it afflicted, causing them to fall into madness before eventually succumbing to death. The plague spread rapidly through the densely populated cities, and within months, the once-thriving civilization had collapsed from within.

## THE DWARVEN PRESENCE

The only inhabitants of Rajapun who were unaffected by the plague were the dwarves who had established small communities on the island. For reasons that remain unclear, the dwarves proved completely immune to the Plague of Akura, allowing them to survive while the human population perished around them.

Today, the dwarves of Rajapun live in isolated settlements scattered throughout the island, maintaining their traditional way of life while avoiding the ruins of the human cities. They are a secretive people who rarely interact with outsiders, preferring to keep to themselves and preserve their cultural traditions. The dwarves have developed their own understanding of the island's history and the events that led to the human civilization's collapse.

## THE RUINS

The ruins of the ancient human cities are scattered throughout the island, though most are now heavily overgrown and difficult to access. These remnants of a once-great civilization include crumbling temples, abandoned marketplaces, and the remains of grand palaces and administrative buildings. The architecture reflects the sophistication of the human inhabitants, with intricate carvings, elaborate mosaics, and advanced engineering techniques that are still impressive even in their current state of decay.

Many of the ruins contain valuable artifacts, ancient texts, and other treasures that have attracted the attention of adventurers and treasure hunters from across Edda. However, those who venture into the ruins often do not return, and those who do are frequently changed by their experience, speaking of strange visions and unexplained phenomena.

## CULTURAL LEGACY

Despite the collapse of human civilization on Rajapun, the cultural legacy of the island's former inhabitants continues to influence the wider world. The artistic and architectural achievements of the Rajapun people are still studied and admired by scholars and craftsmen from other nations. The island's history serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of isolation and the importance of cooperation in times of crisis.

The story of Rajapun has also given rise to numerous legends and superstitions throughout Edda. Many people believe that the island is cursed or haunted by the spirits of those who died during the plague. Others see it as a symbol of the fragility of civilization and the power of nature to reclaim what humans have built.

## CURRENT STATUS

Today, Rajapun remains largely isolated from the rest of Edda, with few people willing to risk the dangers of the island. The dwarven inhabitants continue their quiet existence, maintaining their traditions and avoiding contact with the outside world. The ruins of the human cities stand as silent monuments to a civilization that was destroyed by its own isolation and the cruel hand of fate.

The island's future remains uncertain, though some believe that it may one day be rediscovered and its secrets revealed. For now, Rajapun serves as a reminder of the complex and often tragic nature of history, and the importance of learning from the mistakes of the past.
