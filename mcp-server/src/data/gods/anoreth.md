# Anoreth

## Overview {#overview}

**Anoreth, the Great Weaver**, is the primordial force that existed before the dawn of time, the essence from which all creation sprang forth. In the ancient tongues of Edda, Anoreth is revered as the eternal and omnipresent deity, a being of infinite wisdom and boundless power. It is said that Anoreth's very essence permeates the fabric of the universe, weaving the intricate patterns of existence and infusing all that is with its divine presence.


Long before the first stars ignited in the vast expanse of the cosmos, there was only Anoreth, a singular, formless presence in the void. Anoreth was both the creator and the creation, an endless wellspring of potential and possibility. In the primordial silence, Anoreth began the great work of weaving the tapestry of reality, spinning threads of light and shadow, time and space, life and death.

Anoreth's act of creation was an act of profound artistry and wisdom. With each weave of the cosmic loom, Anoreth brought forth new realms and dimensions, each thread a unique aspect of existence. From these threads, the world of Edda was born. Mountains, oceans, forests, and skies were all woven from the essence of Anoreth, imbued with the divine spark of life.

To fill the world with life, Anoreth separated four parts from itself; each part was then split in two. From the first part were born [Surad](/gods/surad), the First King, and [Ulat](/gods/ulat), the Maelstrom. From the second part came [Agorus](/gods/agorus), the All-Seer, and [Malak](/gods/malak), the Lord of Lies. From the third part came [Ura](/gods/ura), the Dawnbringer, and [Eth-Korel](/gods/eth-korel), the Duskfall. From the fourth came [Thal](/gods/thal), the Arbiter, and [Po](/gods/po), the Everstorm. Separately, the benevolent powers are known as the **Asier**, and the malevolent as the **Malor**. Together, they are the **Urdor**. The balance of their constructive and destructive forces allowed for the cycles of nature and the existence of life.

Throughout the annals of time, Anoreth has maintained a stance of divine impartiality, not intervening directly in mortal affairs. However, history records two instances where Anoreth's hand reached into the realm of mortals. The first occurred during the Schism when the Illyum were cast away from Ulwyll, their ancestral home, as a means to restore balance to the world. Millennia later, at the culmination of the Great War, Anoreth enacted a momentous decree known as the Godsdeath. In this act, the **Urdor** were banished from the mortal realm, their influence waning as they were cast into the depths of the cosmos. These rare interventions serve as stark reminders of Anoreth's omnipotence and the delicate equilibrium it seeks to preserve within the tapestry of existence.

Though Anoreth divided itself to create the **Urdor**, it remains ever-present in the world of Edda. Its essence flows through every living being, every stone, every breath of wind. Those attuned to the mystical arts can sense the presence of Anoreth in the world around them, drawing upon its infinite wisdom and power to shape the world and commune with the divine.

Anoreth's story is one of infinite creation, a reminder that all things are interconnected, and that the essence of the divine flows through the very fabric of reality. In the world of Edda, the legacy of the Great Weaver endures, an eternal testament to the power of creation and the enduring balance of the cosmos.

## Worshippers {#worshippers}

In Edda, only a select few revere Anoreth, as most cultures have long forgotten the ancient creator. Temples dedicated to the Great Weaver are rare and hidden from the eyes of most, adorned with intricate tapestries and mosaics that depict the creation of the world and the divine balance maintained by the **Urdor**. Few are aware of Anoreth's true nature; only [elves](/races/elves), druids, and ancient creatures remember the primordial deity in their prayers.

Druids, referred to amongst themselves as Weavers, are elusive figures who dedicate their lives to understanding and preserving the intricate patterns of existence woven by their deity. They serve as intermediaries between the mortal realm and the divine, guiding the faithful few in their quest for harmony and enlightenment.

## Vassals {#vassals}

In the cosmology of Edda, the elemental beings that inhabit the plane of Astra are seen by some as being directly linked to Anoreth. These ethereal entities, embodiments of the primal forces of nature, are believed to be manifestations of Anoreth's divine essence, shaped by its will and infused with its power. From fiery beings that dance amidst flames to serene entities that ride currents of air, each elemental being reflects a facet of Anoreth's boundless creativity and unfathomable wisdom.
