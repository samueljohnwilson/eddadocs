# Eth-Korel

## Overview {#overview}

Eth-Korel, the Duskfall, is a feared deity revered for his mastery of death and his role as the ultimate judge of mortal souls. As one of the **Malor**, Eth-Korel represents the inevitable end that awaits all living things and the transition from life to whatever lies beyond. His followers see him as the patron of those who work with death—undertakers, executioners, and those who seek to understand the mysteries of mortality. Temples dedicated to Eth-Korel are often somber structures of black stone, built in places where death is common—cemeteries, battlefields, or near ancient burial grounds.

In the early days of creation, Eth-Korel played a crucial role in establishing the natural order of life and death. He is said to have created the first graves, taught mortals how to honor their dead, and established the rituals that would guide souls from life to death. His teachings emphasized that death was not merely an end, but a transition—a necessary part of the cycle that allows new life to flourish. Eth-Korel's influence is felt in every death that brings peace to the suffering, every burial that honors the departed, and every soul that makes the journey to the afterlife.

The Shadow Fields of Eth-Korel are legendary places where his presence is said to be strongest. These somber landscapes are marked by ancient tombs, memorials to the dead, and altars where the living can communicate with those who have passed. Mourners and those seeking to understand death make pilgrimages to these fields to seek Eth-Korel's guidance and to honor the memory of the departed. The fields are tended by the Death Wardens, an order of undertakers and spiritual guides who have dedicated their lives to Eth-Korel's service. Visitors to the Shadow Fields often find themselves blessed with extraordinary insight into matters of death and the ability to comfort those who are grieving.

Since the Godsdeath, when [[Anoreth]] banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Eth-Korel's influence has become more subtle but no less important. Though he no longer walks openly among mortals, his presence is felt in every death that brings release from suffering, in every soul that makes the journey to the afterlife, and in every moment of transition that marks the end of one phase of existence and the beginning of another. His followers believe that Eth-Korel continues to guide souls to their final rest, blessing those who die with dignity and punishing those who would cheat death through unnatural means.

In contemporary times, Eth-Korel is venerated by undertakers, executioners, and all who must deal with the reality of death. His symbols—the scythe, the hourglass, the black rose, and the skull—are common in cemeteries, funeral homes, and places where death is acknowledged throughout Edda. Festivals dedicated to Eth-Korel celebrate the memory of the dead, the importance of honoring those who have passed, and the acceptance of death as a natural part of life. Despite the passage of time and the changes in the world, Eth-Korel's somber spirit continues to guide those who must face the reality of mortality.

## Worshippers {#worshippers}

Eth-Korel's followers include undertakers, executioners, and all who must deal with the reality of death. They are the ones who honor the dead and help the living come to terms with mortality. The cemeteries and funeral homes of Edda are home to many of Eth-Korel's most devoted followers.

In the cemeteries and funeral homes of Edda, the Death Wardens, an order of undertakers and spiritual guides, dedicate their lives to the worship and teachings of the Duskfall. These solemn individuals are renowned for their knowledge of death rituals, their ability to comfort the grieving, and their unwavering commitment to honoring the dead. They live in communities centered around cemeteries, funeral homes, and memorial gardens, where they teach others how to honor the dead and come to terms with mortality. The Death Wardens are particularly known for their ability to communicate with the spirits of the dead and to call upon Eth-Korel's blessing for peaceful transitions. They travel throughout the land, offering their services as undertakers and spiritual counselors and helping to maintain the proper respect for death and the dead.

## Vassals {#vassals}

Eth-Korel's vassals are creatures of death and transition, embodying his somber and inevitable nature.

The most notable of his vassals are the reapers, ethereal beings that take the form of hooded figures with skeletal hands, their faces hidden in shadow, their presence marked by the chill of the grave. These powerful creatures are deeply connected to the worship of Eth-Korel and are said to be his most beloved servants. Reapers are rarely seen by mortals, appearing only to those who are near death or who have earned Eth-Korel's favor. They are known to guide souls to the afterlife, to comfort the dying, and to test the acceptance of those who would understand death. A place blessed by a reaper is said to be protected from the fear of death, where the dying find peace and the dead are honored properly. Encountering a reaper is considered both a blessing and a warning, signaling that Eth-Korel himself has taken an interest in the mortality of the fortunate recipient.
