# Golin

## Overview {#overview}

Golin, the Hunter, is a revered deity celebrated for his connection to the wild and his role in providing sustenance and joy to mortals. As one of the **Asier**, Golin embodies the primal spirit of the hunt and the abundance of the harvest. His followers see him as the patron of hunters, travelers, and all who celebrate life's pleasures. Temples dedicated to Golin are often built in wild places—forest clearings, mountain passes, or near ancient hunting grounds—where his followers can feel close to the natural world he represents.

In the early days of creation, Golin played a vital role in teaching mortals the arts of hunting and survival. He is said to have shown the first hunters how to track game, when to hunt and when to rest, and how to honor the animals they took for food. His guidance helped early humans and dwarves survive in a world filled with danger, teaching them to respect the wild while taking what they needed to survive. Golin's influence is felt in every successful hunt, every bountiful harvest, and every celebration that brings communities together.

The Sacred Hunting Grounds of Golin are legendary places where his presence is said to be strongest. These enchanted forests and plains are home to the most magnificent game animals, creatures that are said to be blessed by Golin himself. Hunters make pilgrimages to these grounds to seek Golin's blessing and to test their skills against the most challenging prey. The grounds are tended by the Rangers of Golin, an order of hunters and guides who have dedicated their lives to his service. Visitors to the hunting grounds often find themselves blessed with extraordinary luck in their hunts and travels.

Since the Godsdeath, when [[Anoreth]] banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Golin's influence has become more subtle but no less important. Though he no longer walks openly among mortals, his presence is felt in the thrill of the hunt, in the bounty of the harvest, and in the joy of community celebrations. His followers believe that Golin continues to guide hunters and travelers, blessing those who respect the wild and honor the traditions of the hunt.

In contemporary times, Golin is venerated by hunters, travelers, farmers, and all who value the wild and the simple pleasures of life. His symbols—the hunting horn, the antlered crown, the sheaf of wheat, and the winding road—are common in hunting lodges, taverns, and places where travelers gather throughout Edda. Festivals dedicated to Golin celebrate the hunt, the harvest, and the joy of community. Despite the passage of time and the changes in the world, Golin's wild spirit continues to inspire those who remember his teachings.

## Worshippers {#worshippers}

Golin's followers include hunters, travelers, farmers, and all who value the wild and the simple pleasures of life. They are the ones who venture into the wilderness and bring back bounty for their communities. The rural communities and hunting lodges of Edda are home to many of Golin's most devoted followers.

In the wild places of Edda, the Rangers of Golin, an order of hunters and guides, dedicate their lives to the worship and teachings of the Hunter. These skilled individuals are renowned for their hunting abilities, their knowledge of the wilderness, and their ability to guide others safely through dangerous lands. They live in communities centered around hunting lodges and waystations, where they teach others the arts of hunting, tracking, and survival. The Rangers are particularly known for their ability to communicate with animals and to call upon Golin's blessing for successful hunts and safe travels. They travel throughout the land, offering their services as guides and hunters and helping to maintain the sacred bond between people and the wild.

## Vassals {#vassals}

Golin's vassals are creatures of the wild and the hunt, embodying his primal and nurturing nature.

The most notable of his vassals are the wildkin, shapeshifting spirits that take the form of magnificent animals—stags with antlers of living wood, wolves with eyes like stars, and eagles with wings that span the sky. These powerful creatures are deeply connected to the worship of Golin and are said to be his most beloved servants. Wildkin are rarely seen by mortals, appearing only to those who are hunting with proper respect or traveling through dangerous wilderness. They are known to guide lost travelers to safety, to lead hunters to the best game, and to protect those who honor the wild and its traditions. A place blessed by a wildkin is said to be filled with abundant game and safe passage, where hunters find success and travelers find their way. Encountering a wildkin is considered a great blessing, signaling that Golin himself has taken an interest in the welfare of the fortunate recipient.
