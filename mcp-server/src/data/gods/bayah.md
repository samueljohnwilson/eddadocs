# Bayah

## Overview {#overview}

**Bayah, the Hearthkeeper**, is the gentle yet steadfast guardian of home and hearth. She is revered by farmers, herdsmen, and all who cultivate the land or tend to the warmth of the home. She represents not only the bounty of the fields but also the bonds of kinship, the comfort of a well-tended fire, and the strength found in community. Though she is a nurturing deity, providing for those who toil with honest labor, she does not abide laziness or waste. The gifts of the earth are meant to be earned and cherished, not squandered.

Bayah's influence extends far beyond the simple act of farming or tending to the home. She is the patron of all those who work with their hands to create and sustain life, from humble farmers and shepherds to skilled craftsmen and artisans. Her teachings emphasize the importance of hard work, community, and the deep connection between people and the land they inhabit. Bayah's followers are known for their strong work ethic, their commitment to their communities, and their deep respect for the natural world.

Throughout the history of Edda, Bayah has been a source of strength and stability during times of hardship and uncertainty. Her wisdom has guided farmers through droughts and floods, her strength has sustained communities through wars and famines, and her warmth has comforted those who have lost their homes and loved ones. During the Great War, Bayah's influence was felt in the countless acts of kindness and generosity that took place amidst the chaos and destruction, her followers working tirelessly to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless.

Bayah's realm in the celestial plane is a place of eternal abundance and warmth, where the souls of those who have lived lives of honest labor and community service find their final rest. Here, in the presence of the Hearthkeeper, all hunger and want are satisfied, replaced by a sense of fulfillment and belonging. Those who have dedicated their lives to feeding and sheltering others are rewarded with eternal comfort, their spirits nourished by the same abundance they provided in life.

In the mortal realm, Bayah's influence is felt through the countless acts of generosity and community service that take place every day. Her temples are places of refuge and nourishment, where the hungry can find food and the homeless can find shelter. Her symbols, the sheaf of wheat and the warm hearth, are common motifs in farms, homes, and other places where life is sustained and nurtured.

Since the Godsdeath, when [Anoreth](/gods/anoreth) banished the **Urdor** from the mortal realm, Bayah's direct influence has diminished, but her legacy endures through the countless acts of generosity and community service that continue to take place in her name. The farmers, craftsmen, and other workers who follow her teachings carry on her work, feeding and sheltering those who need it most.

## Worshippers {#worshippers}

Bayah's followers are those who dedicate their lives to feeding and sheltering others, and to building strong communities. Farmers, herdsmen, and craftsmen often pay homage to the Hearthkeeper, seeking her guidance in their work of sustaining life and building homes. In the realm of [Unterlund](/lands/unterlund), the Even Hand, a religious order dedicated to upholding the law and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens, venerates Bayah as their patron deity. The members of this order, comprised of judges, soldiers, paladins, and scholars, strive to maintain balance and harmony within the realm, dispensing judgment with wisdom and compassion.

The Even Hand's influence extends beyond the borders of Unterlund, as their reputation for fairness and impartiality has spread throughout the lands of Edda. They are often called upon to mediate disputes between nations and to provide guidance in matters of law and governance. Their commitment to Bayah's principles of community and justice has earned them the respect and admiration of rulers and commoners alike.

## Vassals {#vassals}

The most prominent vassals of Bayah are the Storm Heralds, powerful elemental beings that command the winds and rain. These entities serve as intermediaries between Bayah and mortals, often appearing during significant weather events to deliver messages or warnings.

Brounies are the most well-known servants of Bayahâ€”small, unseen fey that dwell in homes, barns, and fields, contributing the smooth running of daily life. Brounies are exceptionally rare, and those lucky enough to be visited by a brouny would do well to show their gratitude. They are said to be no taller than a child, with wiry frames and eyes that gleam like embers in the hearth. Ever industrious, brounies sweep floors, mend broken tools, churn butter, and chase away pests from the grain stores. They show their favour to those who keep a clean home and work diligently, but will abandon any who grow slothful or ungrateful. Tradition holds that leaving a fresh loaf of bread, a bowl of milk, or a warm blanket by the fire will earn a brouny's favor. Though mischievous at times, especially to the lazy, the brounies are ultimately benevolent beings, ensuring that hearths remain warm, larders full, and the harvest plentiful in Bayah's name.
