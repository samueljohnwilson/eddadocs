    The nation of Wydmyn lies in a rugged and mountainous region, bordered by the vast realms of
    Unterlund to the north and the mysterious expanse of Neywyll to the west. This challenging
    terrain has played a significant role in shaping Wydmyn's culture and history, providing natural
    defenses against invaders while fostering a sense of isolation and independence among its
    people. The Wydish, as they are called, have a deep-rooted connection to their land, which is
    reflected in their customs, folklore, and way of life.

    Historically, the Wydish lived in small, self-sufficient villages. They emphasized collective
    effort and mutual aid, and each village was typically governed by a council of elders, respected
    for their wisdom and experience. Prior to the Great War, the Wydish had close ties with the
    elves of Neywyll. This relationship was founded on mutual respect and cooperation, as both
    peoples valued the preservation of their lands and shared a deep connection with the natural
    world. The elves imparted their knowledge of the arcane and ancient traditions to the Wydish,
    enriching their cultural heritage and the men of Wydmyn became renowned for their wealth and
    wisdom.

    However, the Great War shattered the harmony between the Wydish and the elves. When the conflict
    broke out, the Wydish fought valiantly alongside their elven allies. Yet, some among their ranks
    were seduced by promises of power or survival, betraying the elves during the Battle of Twelve
    Kings. This betrayal resulted in catastrophic losses for the Neydan elves, and it was a turning
    point in the war. Afterward, the relationship between the two peoples was irreparably damaged.
    The elves grew distant, their trust shattered by the events of the war.

    In the aftermath of the war, the Wydish made a significant choice that would shape their future.
    Instead of rebuilding their cities and returning to their former way of life, they chose to
    remain nomadic, wandering the lands and patrolling the borders of Neywyll. This decision was a
    show of dedication to their past elvish allies, a way of atoning for their betrayal and proving
    their commitment to safeguarding the elves from further harm.

    After the Great War and the betrayal that fractured the once-strong bond between the Wydmian and
    the elves of Neywyll, the Wydmian people found themselves at a crossroads. A deep divide emerged
    among them. Most of the Wydish chose to remain true to their elvish allies, honoring their
    ancient bonds by protecting the elves of Neywyll from the outside world. Instead of rebuilding
    their cities and returning to their former way of life, they chose to remain nomadic, wandering
    the lands and patrolling the borders. This decision was a show of dedication to their past
    elvish allies, a way of atoning for their betrayal and proving their commitment to safeguarding
    the elves from further harm. However, others turned their backs on this duty, choosing instead
    to reintegrate with human society. Over time, their bond to the elves, and to the land of Wydmyn
    itself, began to fade.Those who stayed in Wydmyn take a dim view of those who left, calling them the
    Aramur, or "lost ones," believing them to have forsaken their heritage.
