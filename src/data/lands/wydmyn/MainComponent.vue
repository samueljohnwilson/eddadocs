    The nation of Wydmyn lies in a rugged and mountainous region, bordered by the vast realms of
    Unterlund to the north and the mysterious expanse of Neywyll to the west. This challenging
    terrain has played a significant role in shaping Wydmyn's culture and history, providing natural
    defenses against invaders while fostering a sense of isolation and independence among its
    people. The Wydmyan, as they are called, have a deep-rooted connection to their land, which is
    reflected in their customs, folklore, and way of life.

    Historically, the Wydmyan lived in small, self-sufficient villages. They emphasized collective
    effort and mutual aid, and each village was typically governed by a council of elders, respected
    for their wisdom and experience. Prior to the Great War, the Wydmyan had close ties with the
    elves of Neywyll. This relationship was founded on mutual respect and cooperation, as both
    peoples valued the preservation of their lands and shared a deep connection with the natural
    world. The elves imparted their knowledge of the arcane and ancient traditions to the Wydmyan,
    enriching their cultural heritage and the men of Wydmyn became renowned for their wealth and
    wisdom.

    However, the Great War changed Wydmyn forever. The conflict led to widespread destruction,
    forcing the Wydmyan to abandon their villages and adopt a nomadic lifestyle. The land they once
    cultivated became battlefields, and many of the traditions they cherished were lost. Today, the
    Wydmyan survive primarily through hunting and foraging, moving across the rugged terrain of
    Wydmyn in search of resources. This nomadic existence has instilled in them a greater sense of
    resilience and adaptability, but it has also made their lives more precarious and uncertain.
