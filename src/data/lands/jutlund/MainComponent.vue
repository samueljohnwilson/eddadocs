    Jutlund is a rugged and untamed land, composed primarily of vast expanses of tundra. This
    landscape shapes the lives of its inhabitants, the Juts, who live in in tune with the cycles of
    nature. The settlements in Jutlund are small and often transient, reflecting the needs and
    movements of the tribal clans that call this place home. Villages, centered around timber and
    thatch longhouses, dot the landscape, rising and falling as the tribes move with the seasons.
    The people's deep connection to their land is evident in their cultural practices, which are
    intimately tied to the rhythms of nature.

    The Jut people are separated into tribal clans, each governing their own territory. The land is
    divided among these independent clans, who maintain a delicate balance between autonomy and
    cooperation. Though often at odds with one another, the clans recognize the necessity of unity
    against external threats, leading to complex alliances that shift with the political landscape.
    The tribal council, made up of chieftains from across the region, plays a critical role in
    maintaining order and coordinating efforts for the common defense. This council reflects the
    intricate social structure that has evolved to suit the rugged terrain of Jutlund.
