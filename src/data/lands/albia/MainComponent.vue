    Albia is a verdant island nation, steeped in ancient history and natural beauty. It is the first
    land where the elves set foot after their exile from Ulwyll, marking the beginning of the Second
    Age. The island is renowned for its lush, green landscapes and majestic cities showcasing high
    elvish architecture and culture. Their cities blend seamlessly with the landscape, with
    architecture that reflects their reverence for nature and their desire to live in harmony with
    it. Intricate treehouses and elegant spires rise above the canopy, connected by winding pathways
    and suspended bridges that allow the elves to move gracefully through their domain. The Albian
    elves are masterful artisans and scholars, their culture thriving on the pursuit of knowledge

    Albia is a nation known for its insular nature and deep-rooted xenophobia. This attitude stems
    from centuries of self-reliance and a desire to preserve their unique cultural heritage. The
    Albian elves have developed a deep suspicion of outsiders, believing that the influence of other
    races could dilute their traditions and way of life. As a result, they are wary of foreign
    visitors and restrict access to their island, allowing only a select few to enter. This guarded
    approach has allowed them to maintain a society largely untouched by external influences,
    ensuring the purity of their customs and beliefs. across Edda.

    The Albian elves have a long-standing tradition of self-sufficiency, cultivating their own food,
    crafting their own goods, and relying on the natural resources of their island. This
    independence has fostered a sense of pride and superiority among the elves, who view their
    society as a model of harmony and sustainability. While other nations might see this as
    arrogance, the Albians see it as a necessary safeguard against the chaos and corruption they
    perceive in the outside world. This attitude is reinforced by stories of past betrayals and
    conflicts that have solidified their resolve to remain isolated.

    Trade with Albia is rare and carefully controlled. The elves export only a few select goods,
    such as exquisite textiles, fine wines, and rare herbs, which are highly sought after in the
    markets of Edda. In return, they import only what they cannot produce themselves, ensuring that
    foreign influences remain minimal. The ports of Albia are closely monitored, with strict
    protocols for inspecting incoming ships and goods. Those who wish to trade with the Albians must
    first prove their trustworthiness and respect for elven customs, a process that can take years
    to achieve.

    The elves of Albia have long prided themselves on preserving the ancient culture of Ulwyll, yet
    over the centuries, their society has evolved in ways that might surprise their own ancestors.
    While they have retained many traditional customs and rituals, the Albians have also embraced a
    form of modernity that reflects their desire for progress and innovation. The Albian elves have
    developed advanced technologies and sophisticated urban centers that demonstrate their
    intellectual and artistic achievements. This departure from the natural world has led to a more
    structured and hierarchical society, where the pursuit of knowledge and excellence takes
    precedence over living in balance with the environment. Ironcially, their Neydan kin have
    remained more true to the ancient ways, despite their rejection of the hope of returning to
    Ulwyll.

    In their quest for innovation, the Albian elves have mastered powerful arcane magic and feats of
    engineering, weaving them together to create wonders that their ancestors in Ulwyll could
    scarcely imagine. However, this embrace of modernity has also led to a degree of separation from
    the natural world, as they prioritize intellectual and cultural pursuits over the traditional
    reverence for nature. While the Albian elves still hold the memory of Ulwyll dear, their
    society's evolution illustrates the dynamic nature of culture and the inevitable changes that
    come with the long passage of time.
