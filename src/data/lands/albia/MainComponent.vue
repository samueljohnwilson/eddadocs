  <v-card-text>
    Albia is a verdant island nation, steeped in ancient history and natural beauty. It is the first
    land where the elves set foot after their exile from Ulwyll, marking the beginning of the Second
    Age. The island is renowned for its lush, green landscapes and majestic cities showcasing high
    elvish architecture and culture. Their cities blend seamlessly with the landscape, with
    architecture that reflects their reverence for nature and their desire to live in harmony with
    it. Elegant spires rise above the canopy, connected by winding pathways and suspended bridges
    that allow the elves to move gracefully through their domain. The Albian elves are masterful
    artisans and scholars, their culture thriving on the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation
    of ancient traditions.

    However, Albia is also known for its insular nature and deep-rooted xenophobia. This attitude
    stems from centuries of self-reliance and a desire to preserve their unique cultural heritage.
    The Albian elves have developed a deep suspicion of outsiders, believing that the influence of
    other races could dilute their traditions and way of life. As a result, they are wary of foreign
    visitors and restrict access to their island, allowing only a select few to enter. This guarded
    approach has allowed them to maintain a society largely untouched by external influences,
    ensuring the purity of their customs and beliefs. across Edda.

    The Albian elves have a long-standing tradition of self-sufficiency, cultivating their own food,
    crafting their own goods, and relying on the natural resources of their island. This
    independence has fostered a sense of pride and superiority among the elves, who view their
    society as a model of harmony and sustainability. While other nations might see this as
    arrogance, the Albians see it as a necessary safeguard against the chaos and corruption they
    perceive in the outside world. This attitude is reinforced by stories of past betrayals and
    conflicts that have solidified their resolve to remain isolated.

    Trade with Albia is rare and carefully controlled. The elves export only a few select goods,
    such as exquisite textiles, fine wines, and rare herbs, which are highly sought after in the
    markets of Edda. In return, they import only what they cannot produce themselves, ensuring that
    foreign influences remain minimal. The ports of Albia are closely monitored, with strict
    protocols for inspecting incoming ships and goods. Those who wish to trade with the Albians must
    first prove their trustworthiness and respect for elven customs, a process that can take years
    to achieve.

    The elves of Albia have long prided themselves on preserving the ancient culture of Ulwyll, yet
    over the centuries, their society has evolved in ways that might surprise their own ancestors.
    While they have retained many traditional customs and rituals, the Albians have also embraced a
    form of modernity that reflects their desire for progress and innovation. The Albian elves have
    developed advanced technologies and sophisticated urban centers that demonstrate their
    intellectual and artistic achievements. This departure from the natural world has led to a more
    structured and hierarchical society, where the pursuit of knowledge and excellence takes
    precedence over living in balance with the environment. Ironcially, their Neydan kin have
    remained more true to the ancient ways, despite their rejection of the hope of returning to
    Ulwyll.

    In their quest for innovation, the Albian elves have mastered powerful arcane magic and feats of
    engineering, weaving them together to create wonders that their ancestors in Ulwyll could
    scarcely imagine. However, this embrace of modernity has also led to a degree of separation from
    the natural world, as they prioritize intellectual and cultural pursuits over the traditional
    reverence for nature. While the Albian elves still hold the memory of Ulwyll dear, their
    society's evolution illustrates the dynamic nature of culture and the inevitable changes that
    come with the long passage of time.

  <v-card-subtitle> History </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Albia's history begins with the exile of the Illyum from Ulwyll, following the Schism. Upon
    their arrival in Albia, the elves sought to recreate the harmony they had known in Ulwyll. The
    island's verdant landscape provided a fertile ground for them to establish a new civilization,
    drawing upon the traditions and knowledge of their ancestors. The elves dedicated themselves to
    preserving the culture and wisdom of their forebears, establishing rituals and practices that
    honored the cycles of nature and the memory of their ancient homeland.

    However, upon their arrival in Albia, the elves faced a major rift in opinion about how to move
    forward from their exile. Some elves, deeply rooted in their memories of Ulwyll, felt a strong
    desire to remain as close to their ancient home as possible, both physically and spiritually.
    These elves, the ancestors of the Albian, believed that by preserving their traditional ways and
    remaining true to the ancient customs of the Illyum, they might one day earn the favor of
    Enoreth and be allowed to return to Ulwyll. They focused on maintaining a way of life that
    mirrored their past, deeply committed to upholding the traditions and rituals that had defined
    their existence in the Old Forest.

  <v-card-subtitle> Religion </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Religion in Albia is deeply rooted in the reverence for Enoreth, reflecting the elves' desire to
    maintain a connection to their ancient Illyum heritage. As the original creator of the elves,
    Enoreth embodies the balance and harmony they strive to achieve, and their worship is
    characterized by a deep respect for the natural order and the preservation of their rich
    cultural history. Temples dedicated to Enoreth are often found nestled within sacred groves,
    where rituals are performed to honor the cycles of nature and the enduring legacy of their
    ancestors. This spiritual connection to the past helps reinforce their identity and provides a
    sense of continuity with their forebears from Ulwyll.

    Alongside their devotion to Enoreth, the Albian have developed an admiration for Agorus, the god
    of knowledge and arcana. This dual worship reflects their pursuit of wisdom and understanding,
    as well as their appreciation for the arcane arts. The Albian have integrated the worship of
    Agorus into their cultural practices, valuing scholarship and intellectual growth as pathways to
    divine insight. Libraries and arcane sanctuaries are common in Albian cities, serving as centers
    for learning and magical study. This combination of ancient reverence for Enoreth and the
    pursuit of arcane knowledge through Agorus sets the Albian elves apart from their kin,
    highlighting their unique blend of tradition and intellectual curiosity.
