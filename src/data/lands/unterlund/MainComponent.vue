  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Unterlund, a nation situated in the western reaches of Edda, stands as a testament to both the
    resilience and ambition of its people. Historically, it was part of the larger realm known as
    Ostramyn, alongside Jutlund and Bjordlund. Over time, Unterlund emerged as an independent
    entity, gradually establishing itself as the most prosperous and populous country in Edda. Its
    success is largely due to its fertile lands, abundant resources, and strategic position as a
    crossroads for trade and cultural exchange. Unterlund's capital, Highdroth, is a bustling hub of
    commerce, where merchants, artisans, and scholars converge to share ideas and goods from across
    the continent.

    The countryside of Unterlund is characterized by rolling hills, vast oak woodlands, and fertile
    plains. Agriculture forms the backbone of the nation's economy, with rich farmlands yielding
    bountiful harvests that sustain both the local population and trade with neighboring regions.
    The climate is temperate, with distinct seasons that bring vibrant colors to the landscape, from
    the blossoms of spring to the golden hues of autumn. This natural beauty, combined with the
    industriousness of its people, has allowed Unterlund to thrive and maintain a stable and
    prosperous society.

    Unterlund is ruled by a hereditary monarchy, with the king holding supreme authority over the
    realm. However, the governance of Unterlund is not conducted in isolation; the king relies on
    the counsel and support of the barons, who rule over their respective fiefdoms in his name.
    These barons, descended from the Andoran nobility that first unified the kingdom, provide
    crucial input on matters of governance, each representing the interests and concerns of their
    regions. While the king's word is law, he often convenes with these barons to discuss national
    issues, ensuring that the needs of each region are considered. The barons are responsible for
    collecting taxes, maintaining local order, and raising troops in times of need. This system of
    governance allows for a balance of power, with the barons serving as a stabilizing force that
    helps maintain the kingdom's unity and prosperity.

  <v-card-subtitle> History </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    For much of the Second Age, Unterlund was dominated by Ostran clans, who engaged in internecine
    warfare for centuries. The stories of their countless battles are now largely lost to history.
    During this time of internal strife, the Andorans emerged as a unified power to the south.
    Though Andor was a much smaller nation than Unterlund, their disciplined and well-trained
    fighting force rapidly swept through the region. By the middle of the Second Age, they had laid
    claim to the Untish throne, unifying the two nations. This unification established a foundation
    for Unterlund's future prosperity, and many of the current lords trace their roots back to the
    first days of that conquest.

    The merging of the Ostran and Andoran peoples created a diverse culture within Edda. The upper
    class and nobility are often of Andoran origin and are known for their piety, studious nature,
    and adherence to law and order, placing great importance on duty to the community. They remain
    somewhat distinct in culture and appearance from their Ostran subjects. In contrast, the
    Ostrans, who are northmen at heart, are renowned for their commitment to family, fiery tempers,
    and love of drink and song. The people that inhabit Unterlund today are descendants of both
    groups. Most Unts are farmers, though those with more Ostran heritage uphold traditions of
    hunting and foraging that date back millennia.

  <v-card-subtitle> Religion </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Religion plays a central role in Unterlund's identity. Almost all Untish people worship Surad,
    with the state only sanctioning religious activities and holidays in his name. Highdroth, the
    capital, serves as the center of religious life in Unterlund and is home to the primary
    religious sects, including the state religion, the Church of the Middle Path. Many of
    Unterlund's religious orders are evangelical, and it is not uncommon to find missionaries
    preaching the glory of Surad in far-flung reaches of Edda. However, in more remote regions,
    aspects of Ostran culture have held out, and other deities such as Ura or Po are worshipped.
