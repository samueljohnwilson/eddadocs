    Garrad is a vast and diverse land, largely characterized by the windswept steppes that stretch
    across most of its territory. The Dal people of the northern and central steppes are nomadic
    horsemen, living in close-knit tribal groups that constantly roam the grasslands. Their way of
    life has been unchanged for millennia, and they are known for their incredible skill on
    horseback, swift cavalry tactics, and expertise in archery. The nomads of Garrad have forged a
    culture that emphasizes mobility, survival, and loyalty to their tribes. Their traditions are
    deeply rooted in the harsh environment they inhabit, where strength, endurance, and adaptability
    are essential for survival.

    To the south, the landscape of Garrad changes dramatically as the steppes give way to the
    coastal region known as the Hundred Isles. This area consists of a chain of dozens of islands,
    each with its own distinct culture, yet sharing similarities in social structure, martial
    traditions, and spiritual beliefs. The culture of the Hundred Isles is reminiscent of a feudal
    society, with powerful warlords and noble families vying for dominance over the islands. The
    people of the Hundred Isles are skilled sailors and warriors, and their naval fleets are known
    to be some of the most formidable in Edda. Their society is hierarchical and governed by a code
    of honor that dictates both personal conduct and military strategy.

    Garrad has long been ruled by a unique system of dual emperors, each representing the distinct
    cultures that dominate the vast nation. In the north, the Dal ethnic group holds sway over the
    expansive steppes, with one of their own—a horselord—ruling as Northern Emperor. This emperor is
    a leader of the tribes, chosen from the most powerful clan to represent the interests of the
    northern steppe peoples. The Northern Emperor is a master of mounted warfare, a symbol of the
    Garradi's enduring connection to the land and their warrior spirit. Under his rule, the steppes
    are unified in their commitment to preserving their way of life, maintaining the traditions of
    mobility, loyalty, and strength.

    Meanwhile, in the south, the Hundred Isles are governed by a bushi emperor—a warrior of the sea
    who upholds the honor and power of the islands. This Southern Emperor is an inherited role, with
    a lineage stretching back for centuries. His role is to safeguard the islands' sovereignty and
    protect the trade routes that are vital to the region's prosperity. Though the two emperors hail
    from vastly different worlds—the Northern Emperor from the windswept plains, and the Southern
    Emperor from the island fortresses—they are bound by a shared duty to lead Garrad as one nation.
    Together, they maintain the delicate balance of power between the north and south, each emperor
    serving as a living symbol of Garrad's dual identity.
