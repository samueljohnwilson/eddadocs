  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The land of Semai is a thriving and influential power, its wealth and influence stretching
    across land and sea. Situated along fertile river valleys and vast deserts, Semai has long been
    a hub of commerce, its bustling markets drawing traders from distant lands. Its cities, adorned
    with intricate stonework and towering minarets, stand as testaments to its prosperity and
    ambition. The people of Semai are renowned for their cunning in trade, their caravans and fleets
    ensuring that goods from every corner of the world pass through their ports and bazaars.

    For much of its history, Semai existed in the shadow of Ithra, the once-great island kingdom
    that controlled the trade routes and dictated the flow of wealth in the region. Ithra's
    influence loomed over the continent, and though Semai flourished as a secondary power, it could
    never surpass its mighty neighbor. That changed with the Great War and the Scourging of Ithra,
    an event that saw Ithra devastated and left in ruins. In the wake of Ithra's fall, Semai stepped
    forward to claim its place as the dominant force of the region, seizing the shattered kingdom's
    maritime supremacy and expanding its own influence far beyond what had ever been possible
    before.

    While Semai is admired for its wealth and the splendor of its cities, its prosperity is not
    without controversy. The Semai have long engaged in the trade of human slaves, a practice that
    many in the wider world find abhorrent. While common in some parts of the world, slavery is
    rejected outright in Ostramyn, and relations between Semai and the nations of the north remain
    tense because of it. Yet Semai does not bend to foreign moralities—it thrives on pragmatism and
    power, and as long as the demand exists, its merchants will continue their trade.

  <v-card-text>
    Despite these moral divides, Semai's mercantile reach is difficult to resist. Its ships sail
    every sea, and its goods—spices, silk, precious metals, and exotic wares—are coveted in every
    great city. Even those who denounce its slave trade cannot deny its importance to global
    commerce, and many of its rivals remain entangled in its economic web. Yet trade alone does not
    define Semai. The kingdom has also built a formidable military, ensuring that no outside force
    can threaten its rise. Its armies, drawn from hardened desert warriors and disciplined soldiers,
    are well-equipped and battle-tested.

    As Semai's power continues to grow, it now finds itself in direct competition with Unterlund,
    the long-standing titan of the northern world. What was once a distant rivalry has turned into
    an open contest for dominance on the world stage. The Semai believe that their time has come,
    that history now favors them as the new masters of trade and empire. Unterlund, however, will
    not relinquish its supremacy without a fight. In this struggle between old and new powers, the
    world watches, uncertain of what the future may hold.

  <v-card-subtitle> Geography </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Semai is a land of stark contrasts, divided between the arid expanse of the Japari Desert in the
    west and the lush, untamed depths of the Sequat Rainforest in the east. The Japari is an endless
    sea of golden dunes, its shifting sands concealing ancient ruins and trade routes that have
    shaped the course of history. The oases scattered across the desert serve as vital lifelines,
    supporting prosperous cities that thrive on commerce and ingenuity. In contrast, the Sequat is a
    land of ceaseless growth, where towering trees form an emerald canopy and rivers carve twisting
    paths through the dense underbrush. It is a wild and untamed land, a place where nature is both
    bountiful and merciless.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-subtitle> People </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The people of Semai are as varied as its geography, divided into two great ethnic groups: the
    Sem and the Bhanipal. The Sem, hailing from the harsh deserts of the west, have long mastered
    the art of survival in one of the most unforgiving environments in the world. They are traders,
    sailors, and shrewd negotiators, ensuring that Semai remains the beating heart of global
    commerce. Their cities, built around the life-giving oases, serve as centers of wealth and
    influence, where the rulers of Semai govern their vast dominion with cunning and ambition. The
    Sem dominate the empire's mercantile class, overseeing the vast trading fleets and caravans that
    make Semai one of the richest nations in the world.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-text>
    In contrast, the Bhanipal are a people of the wild and untamed east, shaped by the verdant chaos
    of the Sequat Rainforest. Where the Sem thrive in the marketplace, the Bhanipal are warriors and
    raiders, living by the strength of their arms and the swiftness of their attacks. They dwell in
    fiercely independent tribal societies, bound by warbands and ancient codes of honor. Though
    often seen as uncivilized by their western counterparts, the Bhanipal hold great sway over the
    empire, for it is they who supply Semai with one of its most lucrative commodities—slaves.
    Through relentless raids into the eastern kingdom of Quat, the Bhanipal capture thousands,
    selling them to the Sem in exchange for weapons, wealth, and influence.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-text>
    This relationship between the Sem and the Bhanipal is one of mutual necessity rather than unity.
    The Sem control the wealth and the great cities, but they rely on the Bhanipal to provide them
    with the labor force that fuels much of their empire. The Bhanipal, in turn, benefit from the
    trade and riches that flow through Semai's markets, ensuring that their warbands remain
    well-armed and their people well-fed. Yet despite this dependence, the two groups have never
    been truly at peace. The Sem see the Bhanipal as little more than savage brutes, necessary but
    dangerous. The Bhanipal, for their part, resent the Sem's haughty superiority, believing that
    their strength and ferocity are what truly sustain the empire.

  <v-card-subtitle> Governance </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The hamjat are a powerful and ambitious caste of land-owning elites in Semai, descended from
    ancient warrior lineages that once carved their fiefdoms through conquest and cunning. Though
    the empire thrives on trade, the hamjat maintain their ancestral warrior ethos, commanding
    private militias and vying for dominance through political intrigue, alliances, and, at times,
    open conflict. There are hundreds of hamjat princelings, each ruling over estates that range
    from fertile riverlands to vast desert strongholds, and their ambitions shape the course of
    Semai's future. Every five years, the ruler of Semai—known as the Asrah—is elected from among
    the hamjat, though the process is often fraught with bribery, assassination, and shifting
    loyalties. While the merchants and scholars of Semai provide the empire with wealth and
    knowledge, it is the hamjat who wield the swords and determine who will sit upon the throne.

  <v-card-subtitle> Religion </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The Sem people revere Thal as the divine embodiment of order. To them, his impartial gaze
    ensures the stability of trade, governance, and society itself. They believe that wealth and
    power must be wielded with wisdom and fairness, lest chaos unravel the intricate systems they
    have built. Temples dedicated to Thal are austere yet imposing, their halls lined with sacred
    texts detailing laws and codes of conduct. Judges and rulers invoke his name when settling
    disputes, and merchants pray for his guidance to ensure that their dealings remain just. To the
    Sem, prosperity is not simply a matter of fortune but of maintaining the equilibrium that Thal
    represents.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-text>
    By contrast, the Bhanipal place their faith in Po, the goddess of battle, embracing her raw and
    untamed might. They believe that strength is the only true law and that Po's blessing manifests
    in the fury of battle and the wild forces of nature. Before their raids, Bhanipal warriors
    perform intense rituals, offering blood and fire to invoke Po's favor. Her storms are seen as
    omens, either granting them strength or warning them away from doomed ventures. While the Sem
    seek stability and structure under Thal's watchful eye, the Bhanipal thrive in the tempest,
    where only the strong survive. Though they are bound by empire, the spiritual divide between
    these two peoples runs deep, reflecting the fundamental contrasts in their way of life.
