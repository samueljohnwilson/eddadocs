      After Eos began to populate the world with humanoid creations, Cerrunos
      offered them his knowledge, acting as a civilizing force for the denizens
      of Edda. For a time, he walked among the first men, serving as a guide and
      leader. For this reason, he is remembered among humans as The First King.

      Cerrunos is rarely roused to anger, but the justice he metes out can be
      perceived as brutal. His devotees are known for their dispassionate
      adherence to law.
