      The half-elves, or ethlyn in Elvish, originated in the early part of the Second Age, when the
      men of Wydmyn formed close ties to the elves of Neywyll. The human race was still new to the
      world then and the elves took pleasure in their companionship. Through their close relations
      with the elves, the men of Wydmyn gained knowledge and wealth far greater than other men could
      imagine. Eventually, some were even welcomed into the ancient elven houses. When the Great War
      descended upon Edda, the men of Wydmyn fought valiantly alongside their elven brethren;
      however, some among their ranks would be corrupted by the darkness.

      The men of Wydmyn fought valiantly alongside the elves, yet the Battle of Twelve Kings marked
      a dark turning point. Some humans, swayed by the dark powers, betrayed the elves, leading to
      catastrophic losses. This betrayal was a bitter blow, and at the war's end, the elves chose to
      withdraw from the world. The Council of Elves decided that no humans could reside in Neywyll
      any longer, and those of mixed blood were expelled, tearing apart families and leaving the
      half-elves in a state of limbo between their two heritages.

      Among the ethlyn, there were some who resented the elves for their expulsion. They would
      return to live among humanity, slowly assimilating into human society and their elven heritage
      fading with time. However, most chose to remain near Neywyll, in the mountains of Wydmyn,
      determined to atone for the past transgressions of their ancestors. They took upon themselves
      the role of guardians, protecting the passage to Neywyll and ensuring that the secluded elves
      were not disturbed by the ever-expanding reach of human civilization.

      Today, the half-elves of Wydmyn lead a nomadic lifestyle, a choice driven by both necessity
      and tradition. They strive to maintain a deep connection to the land, moving with the seasons
      and living off what nature provides. Their nomadic existence allows them to patrol their
      territories effectively, ensuring that outsiders do not encroach upon the borders of Neywyll.
      This way of life, though difficult, is embraced with a sense of duty and honor, as they uphold
      the ancient oaths to protect their elven kin.

      Blessed with the elvish insight into the natural world, ethlyn possess a keen understanding of
      Anoreth's mysteries. This unique perspective allows them to live in harmony with nature,
      drawing from the wisdom passed down by their elven ancestors. While those who dwell among
      humans have often adopted the worship of the Asier, the half-elves of Wydmyn continue to
      revere the natural world in a manner akin to the elves, fostering a spiritual connection that
      transcends their dual heritage.

      Half-elves are not confined solely to the lands of Wydmyn; they also emerge from the unions of
      individual Vaedan or Albian elves with humans. Such relationships are exceptionally rare, so
      it is difficult to speak in generalities about half-elves born of them. Unlike the ethlyn of
      Wydmyn, other half-elves do not form distinct cultures but instead lead lives influenced by
      their mixed heritage and the societies around them. Most half-elves of this kind reside in
      human cities, though a few might remain amongst the elves, depending on the circumstances of
      their birth.

      Ethlyn descended from Vaedan are rare beings. Those few that exist are found in Ithra, where
      the remnants of the once-great Vaedan civilization lie. Vaedan elves are known for their
      historical pursuit of pleasure and wealth, and this influence permeates the lives of their
      half-elven offspring. These half-elves often find themselves drawn to the great cities of
      Ithra, where the vibrancy and opportunities of city life align with their natural adaptability
      and charm. Their Vaedan lineage grants them an innate appreciation for art, music, and the
      finer things in life, and they often excel as artists, musicians, or diplomats, navigating the
      complex social landscapes with ease.

      Rarest among the half-elves are those born of the Albian elves. The Albian strive to live in a
      manner reminiscent of their ancestors in hopes of returning to Ulwyll. As such, relationships
      between Albian elves and humans are highly irregular. Those that do exist are not allowed to
      remain in Albia, if born there. Instead, they are sent to the Acumenium in Ithra where they
      are welcomed by the Farsirs sect. They typically possess a heightened aptitude for the arcane
      arts, a legacy of their Albian heritage. As such, the Farsirs welcome them as highly desirable
      students. Albian half-elves that are born in human lands would also be welcomed to the
      Acumenium, though the are typically raised by their human parent. Despite lacking a cohesive
      culture of their own, the Albian ethlyn frequently become mages, scholars, sages, or
      librarians, serving as bridges between the mystical past of the Albian elves and the evolving
      human societies.
