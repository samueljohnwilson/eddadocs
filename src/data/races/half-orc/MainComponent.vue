      Half-orcs in Edda inhabit a world where they are constantly reminded of their dual heritage,
      one that casts a long shadow over their existence. Born from the often-violent encounters
      between orc raiders and human settlements in the north, half-orcs are frequently stigmatized
      and shunned by both parent races. This social alienation defines much of their lives, as they
      struggle to find acceptance and belonging in a world that views them with suspicion and fear.
      Despite the prejudice they face, many half-orcs are resilient and determined to carve out
      their own place in society, often developing a tough exterior to shield themselves from the
      harsh judgments of others.

      Physically, half-orcs inherit traits from both humans and orcs, resulting in a striking and
      often intimidating appearance. They typically possess the muscular build and prominent
      features of their orcish ancestry, including greenish or grey skin and pronounced brows, and
      sometimes even tusks, while retaining some of the more delicate features of their human
      lineage. This unique combination can make them stand out uncomfortably in both human and orc
      communities. Yet, their physical prowess and resilience are undeniable, often making them
      formidable warriors and laborers, capable of enduring hardships that might break others.

      Socially, half-orcs face a difficult journey. In human settlements, they are often treated
      with suspicion and disdain, viewed as reminders of past traumas and ongoing threats. The
      orcish tribes, meanwhile, typically regard them as weak or inferior due to their human blood.
      This dual rejection forces many half-orcs to live on the fringes of society, often
      among bands of outlaws or mercenaries. Within these groups, they find some solidarity and
      understanding, creating a unique culture that values strength, loyalty, and perseverance in
      the face of adversity.

      The psychological impact of being born from violence and rejection shapes the identity of many
      half-orcs. Some wrestle with anger and resentment, struggling to reconcile the darker aspects
      of their origins. Others channel their experiences into positive pursuits, becoming champions
      of the downtrodden and defenders of justice. Their mixed heritage often grants them unique
      perspectives, allowing them to bridge cultural divides and mediate conflicts between humans
      and orcs, though such roles are challenging to navigate given the deep-seated biases they must
      confront.

      Despite the hardships they face, many half-orcs exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt and
      thrive. Their lives are defined by a constant struggle for acceptance and purpose, which can
      lead to impressive achievements in various fields. Some become renowned warriors, mercenaries,
      or adventurers, using their physical prowess to carve out reputations that command respect.
      Others find roles as diplomats, guides, or traders, utilizing their understanding of both
      human and orcish societies to foster cooperation and trade between the two races.

      Ultimately, the story of the half-orcs in Edda is one of resilience and defiance in the face
      of prejudice and adversity. Their existence challenges the established norms and forces the
      people of Edda to confront uncomfortable truths about identity, heritage, and acceptance.
      Through their perseverance, half-orcs carve out a niche for themselves, proving that they are
      more than the sum of their origins. In doing so, they contribute to the rich tapestry of
      Edda's cultures, offering lessons in strength, survival, and the quest for belonging.
