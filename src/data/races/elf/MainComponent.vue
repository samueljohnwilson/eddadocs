      The elves are the most ancient race in Edda, tracing their lineage back to the ancient Illyum.
      Anoreth created the <strong>Illyum</strong>, the first sentient race, from the roots of
      <strong>Ael, the First Tree</strong>. For millennia, the Illyum lived in harmony with the
      natural world in <strong>Ulwyll, the Old Forest</strong>. However, over time, both the Asier
      and the Malor jealously sought to compel the Illyum into their service. This gradual influence
      caused a division among the Illyum, ultimately leading to a conflict known as the War of the
      Schism. The war raged in Ulwyll for nearly a thousand years, with beings from Eya and Mora
      joining the ranks of the Illyum to fight alongside them. Those who worshipped the Malor became
      corrupted, their descendants becoming the orcs, while those who followed the Asier were
      blessed, their descendants becoming the elves.

      The Schism continued for nearly 1000 years, prompting Anoreth to intervene directly
      for the first time. To restore balance to Ulwyll, Anoreth cast the Illyum away from the First
      Tree, forcing them into exile from their ancient home. The exiles traveled across the sea to
      the west, arriving in Edda. Anoreth's intervention not only ended the prolonged war but also
      reshaped the world's power dynamics. The orcs and elves spread across the realms of Edda,
      establishing their own societies and cultures. The Urdor, banished along with the other
      Illyum, roamed the lands, influencing events throughout the Second Age. The group of Illyum
      allowed to stay in Ulwyll remained vigilant protectors of the First Tree, ensuring that the
      balance of Anoreth was maintained. This era of transformation and exile set the stage for the
      events that would unfold in Edda, shaping the destinies of the orcs, elves, and other
      inhabitants of the world.

      Among the elves that arrived in Edda, there are 3 lineages: the
      <strong>Neydan</strong>, the <strong>Albian</strong>, and the <strong>Vaedan</strong>. The
      history and experiences of the three elven lineages reflect the paths taken by their people in
      response to their shared banishment from Ulwyll. Each group has developed its own distinct
      culture and way of life, shaped by their environment, choices, and the challenges they have
      faced. While they may no longer be united as a single people, the elves of Edda remain bound
      by a common heritage and a deep connection to their ancient past.

      Upon arriving in Edda after their banishment from Ulwyll, the Old Forest, the Neydan felt a
      great shame. They believed that they had lost the blessing of Anoreth and chose to travel far
      from the isle of Albia where the elves had landed. They journeyed west until they reached a
      land they called Neywyll, the Young Forest. There, they created a new life, living humbly to
      atone for their perceived sins against the will of Anoreth. Eventually, long after men had
      awakened, they grew close with the men of Wydmyn, even intermarrying with them. However, this
      bond was shattered with the Betrayal of Alaric during the Great War. Since then, the Neydan
      have retired from the world, living a reclusive existence deep in their forest, wary of
      outsiders and protective of their renewed connection to nature.

      The Albian believe that Anoreth will one day forgive them and allow them to return to Ulwyll.
      Choosing to remain on the isle of Albia, they strive to live their lives as closely to the
      lives of their ancestors as possible. The Albian have a greater proficiency with magic than
      any other races in Edda, their culture high-minded and austere. They built towering cities of
      ethereal beauty, interwoven with arcane enchantments that reflect their deep connection to the
      mystical. Their disciplined lifestyle and pursuit of knowledge and magical prowess set them
      apart, making them both revered and envied by other races.

      The Vaedan, in contrast, chose to venture out and seek worldly pleasures. Traveling south,
      they developed a civilization that rivaled any in the history of Edda. Their kingdom, Vahran,
      was the greatest in the early days of the Second Age, renowned for its wisdom and wealth.
      However, their prosperity bred greed and lust among the people, and the kingdom began to
      crumble from within. Despite their decline, the Vaedan continued their pursuit of pleasure and
      luxury for centuries. The Scourging of Edda eventually claimed the last of their worldly
      wealth, leaving the few remaining Vaedan to live as nomads in the deserts of Ithra, clinging
      to the remnants of their once-great civilization.

      The Neydan, despite their retreat into the Young Forest, maintain a rich cultural heritage.
      They are skilled artisans and scholars, preserving ancient knowledge and crafts passed down
      through generations. Their architecture is seamlessly integrated with the natural environment,
      creating serene and harmonious living spaces. While they avoid contact with other races, they
      remain vigilant protectors of their forest home, ensuring that it remains a sanctuary for both
      their people and the myriad creatures that dwell within it.

      The Albian, on the other hand, continue to hone their magical abilities, delving into arcane
      studies that push the boundaries of known magic. Their libraries are vast repositories of
      ancient tomes and scrolls, and their scholars are respected throughout Edda. Albian society is
      highly structured, with a clear hierarchy that reflects their belief in order and discipline.
      They see themselves as the custodians of elven tradition and are determined to uphold the
      values and knowledge of their ancestors until the day they are welcomed back to Ulwyll.

      For the Vaedan, life in the deserts of Ithra is harsh and unforgiving. Yet, they have adapted,
      becoming skilled survivors in a hostile environment. They are traders and wanderers, known for
      their cunning and resourcefulness. The remnants of their former grandeur can be seen in the
      intricate jewelry and artifacts they create and trade. Despite their fall from power, the
      Vaedan retain a sense of pride and identity, driven by a fierce determination to endure and
      find meaning in their nomadic existence.
