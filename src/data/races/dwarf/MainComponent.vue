      OVERVIEW
    </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      The dwarves inhabit Hethskein, the northernmost reach of Edda. There are
      two groups of dwarves: those of the <strong>mountain</strong> and those of
      the <strong>tundra</strong>.

    <v-card-text>
      The <strong>mountain dwarves</strong> live within Hethe, the great volcano
      that towers above all other peaks in Edda. The dwarves have tunnelled deep
      into its depths and the winding, labyrinthine shafts are home to many
      dwarven communities. Near the mountain's top stands the fortress,
      Hethedun, which is the seat of the dwarfish king and the site of a great
      forge, powered by the very magma that flows from the earth below.

      The <strong>tundra dwarves</strong> live scattered across Hetheskein.
      Their ancestors left the mountain long ago, following a religious schism
      that divided the dwarves of Hethe. They believe that the teachings of
      Othar entreat his followers to choose freedom above all else, so they live
      in loose-knit tribes with little distinct hierarchy. Though they do roam
      the tundra, hunting and foraging, they have not forsaken the underground
      entirely: they often use glacial caverns as their residence, sometimes
      occupying the same site for months or years before moving on. Though the
      dwarves maintain respectful relations, the mountain dwarves tend to look
      upon the tundra dwarves as coarse and barbaric, and the tundra dwarves see
      their mountain-dwelling kin as rigid and prudish.

      Culture
    </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      The <strong>mountain dwarves</strong> prize education, the development of
      practical skills, and the dignity of physical labour. Their studious and
      hard-working culture tends to produce knowledgable and skilled citizens.

      The <strong>tundra dwarves</strong> value experiences above possessions,
      revelling in the dramatic northern sunsets or in watching the caribou
      herds stampede across the landscape. They are attuned to the pulse of
      their land and to the natural world at large.

      Religion
    </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      All dwarves worship Othar, though in their own ways.

      The <strong>mountain dwarves</strong> consider productivity, diligence,
      and patience to be the core values of a good life. Their church is known
      as the House of Othar, but in conversations among dwarves, they simply
      refer to it as the House. The head of the order is known as the Raester
      <span class="translate">(Dwarvish: Forgemaster)</span>. Traditionally a
      male, he is chosen for the role based on his adherence to the religion's
      values, his standing in the community, and his skill as a smith. Though
      any dwarf can become the Raester, it has long been common for high
      families to enroll their second-born sons in the priesthood to become
      candidates; the Raester takes no wife, but the the position is second only
      to the king in its political power. Worship is centred around the Great
      Forge of Hethedun, which is powered by the magma that flows out from the
      volcano below. When not studying scripture, the priests of the order spend
      much of their time working at the forge.

      In the middle of the Second Age, a dwarf named Inga Ethwred ascended to
      the role of Raester and upended the religious establishment with his
      proclamations regarding the will of Othar; this eventually lead to a
      religious schism known as the Sunder. Following the split, Ethwred led his
      followers into the tundra, where they established a less-restrictive way
      of worshipping Othar. The <strong>tundra dwarves</strong> call themselves
      the Wethwen <span class="translate">(Dwarvish: True Sons)</span> and their
      worship centres on the freedom that Othar gave his creations. They believe
      that they honour him by casting aside comfort and living a life without
      restraint. As a result of the Sunder, a common curse among the mountain
      dwarves is 'wen wey Inga'
      <span class="translate">(Dwarvish: son of Inga)</span>, which is roughly
      equivalent to 'son of a bitch' or 'bastard'.
