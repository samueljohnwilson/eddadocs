    <v-card-subtitle> Overview </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      Halflings are a small and nimble race known for their love of peace and simple pleasures. They
      primarily inhabit the rolling hills and fertile valleys of the Unterlund, though they do live
      in the other southern nations; a few have even ventured so far as Bjordlund, but the cold does
      not suit their tastes, nor their proclivity for going about without shoes. They live in
      tight-knit communities centered around farming and trade. Their villages are often hidden from
      sight, nestled within the landscape, with homes built into hillsides and covered with lush
      greenery. In the country, the <strong>fieldfolk</strong> tend to live in separate communities,
      though often directly neighbouring human settlements. In the city, the
      <strong>cityfolk</strong> either manage in an oversized world or carve out their own small
      neighbourhoods, which are better equipped to accommodate their diminutive size.

      The <strong>fieldfolk</strong> are known as simple and good-hearted people, if a little naive.
      Most of them are content to tend their gardens, smoke their pipe-weed, and while away their
      days in peace and quiet. However, in times of trouble, they have proven themselves to be brave
      and loyal citizens of the kingdoms in which they dwell. There are few men that have spent time
      among the fieldfolk and come away with a harsh word on their lips. Their lifestyle is deeply
      rooted in agriculture and craftsmanship. They are renowned for their skill in cultivating
      crops, particularly those that yield fruits and grains. Their markets are vibrant and lively,
      attracting traders from far and wide. Halflings have a keen eye for quality and are known to
      barter with shrewdness and wit, ensuring their communities thrive economically.

      In many cases, the <strong>cityfolk</strong> have inhabited the cities they call home for many
      generations. They have cultures that reflect the human society around them, while still
      retaining some of the characteristics and heritage of their halfling roots. In order to
      provide value to the human societies they inhabit, they have learned to embrace certain roles,
      including merchants, moneylenders, librarians, scholars, and jurists. Through their long lives
      and strong familial connections, they have a tendency to possess greater education and
      material wealth than many of the humans the live alongside. This can occasionally lead to
      unfortunate resentments or stereotypes being attributed to cityfolk, but overall, they are
      well-regarded and accepted members of society.

      Culturally, halflings place a strong emphasis on community and family bonds. Their societies
      are built on mutual support and cooperation, with decisions often made collectively through
      village councils. Storytelling and music are central to their social life, with gatherings
      around the hearth to share tales and songs being a cherished tradition. Halflings have a rich
      oral history, with legends and folklore passed down through generations. They take great pride
      in their heritage and are adept at using humor and cleverness to navigate challenges. This
      cultural resilience has enabled them to endure and thrive amidst the changing tides of
      history.

      Though halflings generally prefer a peaceful existence, they are not without their own form of
      heroism. Many halflings have ventured beyond their tranquil villages to explore the wider
      world, driven by a curiosity and wanderlust that belies their homebound reputation. These
      adventurers are known for their resourcefulness and bravery, often relying on their wit and
      agility to overcome obstacles. Halflings are also skilled in the use of slings and throwing
      weapons, which they wield with surprising accuracy. While they may not seek out conflict, they
      are fiercely protective of their homes and will defend them with unwavering determination if
      threatened.
