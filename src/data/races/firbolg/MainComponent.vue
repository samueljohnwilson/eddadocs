      Among the furthest depths of Neywyll, the firbolg dwell as ancient guardians of the forest. To
      the men of Edda, the elves are figures of legend, but to the elves themselves, the firbolg are
      enshrouded in even greater mystery. These enigmatic beings are seldom seen, and their solitary
      nature fuels the myths that surround them. Leading lives of seclusion, they wander the forest
      alone, often spending months or even years in silent contemplation. With lifespans that
      stretch across many centuries, most firbolg alive today carry the memories of the Second Age,
      though they rarely share their knowledge with outsiders.

      The appearance of the firbolg is both striking and imposing. They resemble enormous humans,
      standing tall with long, pointed ears that mark their otherworldly heritage. Their skin is
      slightly grey, and their hair, often left uncut and their beards untrimmed, flows in a unkempt
      cascade. However, fibolg possess the ability to take on the physical characteristics of elves
      and humans, allowing them to pass among those groups when the need arises.

      Residing in Neywyll long before the elves set foot in its verdant realm, the firbolg are seen
      as ancient custodians of the forest. They exist in a state of profound solitude, eschewing the
      trappings of civilization and living in harmony with the natural world. Their lives are deeply
      intertwined with the rhythms of the forest, and they are said to possess an intimate
      understanding of its secrets, communicating with the trees and creatures in a language only
      they comprehend.

      The spiritual beliefs of the firbolg revolve around Anoreth, whom they reverently call
      'Laeth,' meaning 'That Which Is' in the Sylvan tongue. Their worship is not structured in
      rituals or temples but is instead a deep, personal connection to the divine essence they
      perceive in the world around them. To the firbolg, Anoreth is the embodiment of all that
      exists, a presence that permeates every leaf and stone within Neywyll. Their devotion is
      reflected in their role as protectors of the forest, ensuring its continued flourishing in the
      face of time's passage.

      As stewards of Neywyll, the firbolg hold a unique position within the forest's delicate
      ecosystem. It is said that when elves reach the end of their long lives, they travel deep into
      the most ancient forests of Neywyll to seek out a firbolg. What transpires during these
      encounters is not known, even to the elves, but it is believed that the firbolg aid them
      in transitioning to whatever lies beyond. This ritual underscores the deep bond between the
      elves and firbolg, a connection forged in mutual respect and understanding of the natural
      world.

      The firbolg's existence remains a testament to the enduring power of nature and the ancient
      ties that bind the inhabitants of Neywyll. Though they are few in number, their presence looms
      large in the hearts of those who know of them. To the elves and the forest creatures alike,
      the firbolg are more than mere guardians; they are living embodiments of Neywyll's spirit,
      steadfast in their duty and unwavering in their connection to Anoreth's timeless will. Through
      their solitary vigil, the firbolg ensure that the mysteries of Neywyll endure, untouched by
      the ravages of time.
