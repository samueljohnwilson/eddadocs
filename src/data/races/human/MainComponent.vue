    <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      The men of Edda are a diverse race and they have come to inhabit much of the continent. There
      are four kingdoms of men: Bjordlund, Unterlund, Garrad, and Ithra. They are divided among two
      regions: Ostramyn and Balamyn. Their cultures, religious beliefs, and social structures vary
      enormously from place to place.

    <v-card-subtitle> Culture </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      <strong>Ostramyn</strong> is an Elvish word that translates as 'the land of the northern men'
      in Common; the inhabitants of the region are known as the Ostrans
      <span class="translate">(Elvish: Northeners)</span>. It is composed of Bjordlund and northern
      Unterlund. A third nation, Jutlund, once existed between Bjordlund and Unterlund, but it was
      absorbed by the expansion of its neighbours; despite this, its culture is still distinct in
      many ways. Today, the Ostrans are divided into two national identities, the Bjords and the
      Juts. The tribes of the north commonly come into conflict with one another, but they have
      traditionally unified against external threats. A common saying among the Ostrans is "North,
      blood, honor", in reference to the values they hold.

      <strong>Balamyn</strong> is Elvish for the 'land of the southern men'. It is composed of
      Garrad, Ithra, and southern Unterlund. The inhabitants of Balamyn are more diverse than the
      men of the north. Each have their own distinctive culture that distinguish them from their
      neighbours. As such, Balamyn is often used in describing geography, but rarely culture.

      Humans in Edda are known for their adaptability and resilience, thriving in diverse
      environments and building civilizations across the realm. Unlike other races, humans are not
      bound to one particular area or culture, allowing them to develop a wide array of societies
      and traditions. From the northern tribes that roam the tundra to the southern kingdoms with
      their sprawling cities, humans have proven their ability to endure and flourish in any
      climate. This adaptability has enabled them to play a significant role in the political and
      cultural landscape of Edda, often serving as mediators and innovators among the various races.

      One of the defining characteristics of humans is their ambition and drive for progress. While
      other races may focus on preserving their traditions, humans are constantly seeking new
      knowledge and ways to improve their lives. This thirst for advancement has led to significant
      technological and magical developments throughout history, as humans push the boundaries of
      what is possible. Their societies are often bustling centers of trade and learning, where
      different cultures come together to share ideas and discoveries.
    </v-card-text>
    <v-card-text>
      Despite their achievements, humans are also known for their propensity for conflict. Their
      diverse cultures and ambitions often lead to tensions and rivalries, both within their own
      societies and with other races. Wars and political struggles are common in human history, as
      leaders vie for power and control over resources. However, these conflicts also drive humans
      to develop new strategies and alliances, contributing to their growth and evolution over time.

    <v-card-subtitle> Religion </v-card-subtitle>
    <v-card-text>
      Humans are more diverse in their religious beliefs than other races. While the kingdoms of men
      all currently worship the Eyar, there was a time when the hearts and minds of kings were
      corrupted by the Malor and men flew the banners of the dark lords.

      Religion and spirituality play a significant role in human societies, with beliefs varying
      widely across different cultures. Most humans worship the Asier in some form, seeking guidance
      and protection from the divine, though some groups have forgone religion entirely. Few humans
      are even aware of the existence of Anoreth, with the exception of druids and the like. This
      diversity of belief systems reflects the humans' adaptability and openness to different ideas.
      Though today, worship of the Malor is relegated to the shadows, there was a time when the
      hearts and minds of kings were corrupted by the Malor and men flew the banners of the dark
      lords.
