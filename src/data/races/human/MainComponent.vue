      Overview

    <v-card-text>
      The men of Edda are a diverse race and they have come to inhabit much of
      the continent. There are four kingdoms of men: Bjordlund, Unterlund,
      Garrad, and Ithra. They are divided among two regions: Ostramyn and
      Balamyn. Their cultures, religious beliefs, and social structures vary
      enormously from place to place.

      <strong>Ostramyn</strong> is an Elvish word that translates as 'the land
      of the northern men' in Common; the inhabitants of the region are known as
      the Ostrans <span class="translate">(Elvish: Northeners)</span>. It is
      composed of Bjordlund and northern Unterlund. A third nation, Jutlund,
      once existed between Bjordlund and Unterlund, but it was absorbed by the
      expansion of its neighbours; despite this, its culture is still distinct
      in many ways. Today, the Ostrans are divided into two national identities,
      the Bjords and the Juts. The tribes of the north commonly come into
      conflict with one another, but they have traditionally unified against
      external threats. A common saying among the Ostrans is "North, blood,
      honor", in reference to the values they hold.

      <strong>Balamyn</strong> is Elvish for the 'land of the southern men'. It
      is composed of Garrad, Ithra, and southern Unterlund. The inhabitants of
      Balamyn are more diverse than the men of the north. Each have their own
      distinctive culture that distinguish them from their neighbours. As such,
      Balamyn is often used in describing geography, but rarely culture.

      Humans are more diverse in their religious beliefs than other races. While
      the kingdoms of men all currently worship the Eyar, there was a time when
      the hearts and minds of kings were corrupted by the Malor and men flew the
      banners of the dark lords.
