    Demons are beings of pure evil, created by the Malor to serve their dark purposes and spread
    malevolence throughout the planes of existence. They embody corruption, deceit, and chaos,
    existing to undermine the divine order established by the Asier. Their forms and roles are
    diverse, reflecting the varied aspects of darkness they represent. Demons are not a monolithic
    group but are instead divided by their allegiance to different Malor, each shaping their
    behaviors and objectives in distinct ways.

    Demons devoted to Eth-Korel follow a perverse rule of law. These entities thrive on twisted
    interpretations of justice and order, enforcing a brutal and authoritarian regime in the
    infernal realms. Their actions are characterized by a rigid adherence to the decrees of
    Eth-Korel, often imposing cruel and unusual punishments on those who defy their master's will.
    This demonic subsect values control and domination, using their power to subjugate and torment
    souls in a meticulously structured manner. Their perverse sense of order is a dark mirror of the
    celestial laws upheld by the Asier, corrupting the principles of justice to serve their own
    nefarious ends.

    In stark contrast, demons devoted to Malak are self-serving and duplicitous. These beings are
    masters of deception and betrayal, constantly scheming to advance their own interests. They are
    driven by an insatiable hunger for power and are willing to manipulate and deceive anyone to
    achieve their goals. Their loyalty is fleeting and conditional, often shifting alliances to suit
    their current ambitions. The influence of Malak imbues these demons with a cunning and
    opportunistic nature, making them highly effective in spreading discord and mistrust. Their
    actions are calculated to maximize their own gain, regardless of the cost to others.

    Demons aligned with Ulat seek only chaos and destruction. These agents of annihilation revel in
    causing mayhem and tearing apart the fabric of reality. They embody the primal force of
    destruction, acting without regard for order or reason. Their presence brings devastation,
    leaving a trail of ruin in their wake. Unlike the more calculated and strategic approaches of
    other demonic factions, Ulat's demons are driven by a pure, unrelenting desire to destroy. Their
    chaotic nature makes them unpredictable and extraordinarily dangerous, as they act on impulses
    that can turn entire regions into wastelands.

    The origins of these demons trace back to the very essence of the Malor, each Malor imparting a
    fragment of their dark nature into the beings they create. This connection binds demons to their
    respective masters, shaping their actions and purposes in the mortal and infernal realms.
    Despite their differences, all demons share a common goal: to undermine and destroy the order
    established by the Asier. Their methods and motivations may vary, but their endgame is always
    aligned with the broader objectives of the Malor they serve.

    In the mortal realm, demons are an unseen threat, their influence often felt through the
    actions of mortals who fall under their sway. Whether through direct confrontation or subtle
    manipulation, demons strive to corrupt and destroy. Their presence is a reminder of the
    ever-present danger posed by the forces of darkness, a counterbalance to the divine light of the
    Asier. Though many demons have been banished or destroyed over the ages, their lingering
    influence continues to shape the destinies of those who encounter them, leaving an indelible
    mark on the fabric of existence.
