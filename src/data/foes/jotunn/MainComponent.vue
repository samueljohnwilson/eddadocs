    In the mythic lands of Edda, races of giants, known collectively as jotunn, roam the vast and
    varied landscapes, each type reflective to its unique environment. These colossal beings are
    revered and feared, embodying the primal forces of nature and the raw power of the world. They
    were the final races to be created by Ura, prior to the creation of humans.

    Klagan, or hill giants, are the most numerous of the jotunn. These massive beings, with their
    earthy tones and brutish strength, inhabit rolling hills and sprawling plains. They are often
    seen herding great beasts or uprooting trees with ease, their rudimentary societies marked by a
    love of simple pleasures and crude craftsmanship. Despite their seemingly slow-witted nature,
    Klagan possess a deep connection to the land, sensing shifts in the earth and changes in the
    wind.

    Hrind, or frost giants, dwell in the icy wastes of the north, their blue-tinged skin and
    frost-rimed hair blending seamlessly with the frozen landscape. These giants are warriors of
    unparalleled might, their societies structured around combat and survival in the harshest of
    climates. Hrind are often found in icy caverns, wielding weapons forged from enchanted ice and
    metals, their breath freezing the air and their footsteps shaking the snow-covered ground.

    Rungir, or stone giants, live only on the tropical island of Rajapun. With skin resembling
    granite and dark eyes that gleam like obsidian, these giants live in harmony with the lush
    environment, sensing the subtle tremors of volcanic activity and the flow of subterranean
    rivers. They have called the island home since time immemorial, thriving in the dense jungles
    and along the rugged coastlines. Their society is highly hierarchical, with the oldest and
    largest giants holding positions of great authority and respect, guiding their people with
    wisdom drawn from the natural rhythms of the earth.

    Thrym, or storm giants, are the most awe-inspiring of the jotunn, towering figures who command
    the very forces of the sky. With hair that crackles like lightning and voices that boom like
    thunder, thrym dwell on the island of Albia and the surrounding Green Isles. These giants
    possess the ability to control weather, summoning tempests or calming storms at will. Their
    society values wisdom and strength, with elders who can foresee the future in the patterns of
    the stars and the shifting of the clouds.

    The jotunn, despite their differences, share a common heritage and deep-seated respect for their
    ancestral traditions. Their myths and legends speak of a time when giants walked alongside the
    Urdor, shaping the world and its many wonders. Today, they tend to live far from civilization,
    so for many of the peoples of Edda, they exist more as myth than reality. However, they remain
    formidable figures in the lore of Edda, their presence a constant reminder of the power and
    majesty of the natural world.

    Interactions between humans and jotunn are rare and often fraught with tension. Some tales speak
    of alliances forged in times of great need, while others recount tragic conflicts born of
    misunderstanding and fear. Despite their intimidating stature and power, the jotunn are complex
    beings, capable of great kindness and terrible wrath, their actions guided by ancient codes of
    honor and respect for the forces that birthed them.
