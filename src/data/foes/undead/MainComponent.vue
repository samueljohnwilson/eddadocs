    Undead creatures in Edda are remnants of the Malor's dark influence during the Great War. In
    that tumultuous time, the Malor raised vast armies of the undead to wage war against the Asier
    and their mortal followers. These malevolent forces were composed of the reanimated corpses of
    fallen warriors, ancient mages twisted into liches, and spectral apparitions bound by dark
    magic. Though the Great War has ended and the undead armies have largely vanished from the
    mortal plane, the shadows of that era still linger, and pockets of undead creatures continue to
    haunt the world.

    Undead manifest in various forms, each reflecting the dark forces that bind them to the mortal
    plane. Cursed souls, often the result of ancient maledictions or unfinished business, linger as
    restless spirits, unable to find peace and seeking vengeance or resolution. Others are powerful
    dark beings that have sought eternal life through forbidden rituals and dark pacts, trading
    their humanity for immortality and magical prowess. Meanwhile, some are tragic figures, returned
    to the mortal realm against their will by necromancers or other malevolent forces. These diverse
    types of undead embody the different ways that life and death can be perverted by dark magic,
    making them some of the most feared and reviled creatures in Edda.

    In the forsaken ruins of battlefields and ancient crypts, skeletal warriors and zombies remain
    as grim sentinels of the past. These undead are often animated by residual dark magic, their
    decayed forms driven by an insatiable hunger for the living. They lurk in places where death and
    suffering were once rampant, rising from the ground to attack any who dare to disturb their
    eternal rest. These mindless creatures are driven by a primal urge to spread death, often
    forming small hordes that terrorize the surrounding areas.

    Among the most powerful undead are liches, former mages who sought immortality through forbidden
    rituals. These malevolent beings retain their formidable magical abilities and a keen intellect,
    making them formidable adversaries. Liches often seek to reclaim their former power, gathering
    followers and amassing dark knowledge. They dwell in hidden lairs, continuing their twisted
    experiments and plotting to regain influence in the mortal world.

    While the majority of the undead were banished or destroyed after the Great War, isolated
    necromancers and dark cults still exist, seeking to harness the power of the undead for their
    own purposes. These malevolent practitioners of dark magic often delve into forbidden lore,
    raising undead minions to serve their will. They can be found in remote and desolate places,
    conducting grisly rituals to summon and control the undead, posing a constant threat to the
    fragile peace of Edda. The presence of these dark forces ensures that the undead, though
    diminished, remain a persistent and terrifying element of the world.
