    The kodo are a formidable race of lizards from the tropical island of Rajapun. Once mere beasts,
    the kodo have gradually evolved over millennia, developing primitive societies and rudimentary
    tool use. Their appearance remains fiercely reptilian, with scales that blend seamlessly into
    the vibrant greens and browns of the tropical jungle. Despite their evolution, the kodo have
    retained much of their bestial nature, which is reflected in their society and daily lives.

    In the dense jungles and along the winding rivers of Rajapun, the kodo live in tribal
    communities, each led by the strongest and most cunning of their kind. These leaders are often
    brutal warriors who have clawed their way to the top through displays of strength and cunning.
    The kodo have a hierarchical social structure, with hunters and warriors holding the highest
    status, while gatherers and tool-makers occupy lower rungs. This hierarchy is maintained through
    constant displays of dominance and frequent violent confrontations.

    Despite their primitive ways, the kodo have developed a surprising proficiency with tools and
    weapons. They craft spears and clubs from the sturdy wood and sharp stones found in their
    environment. These tools are used not only for hunting the diverse wildlife of Rajapun but also
    in battles against rival tribes and in defense against larger predators. The kodo are skilled
    hunters, their predatory instincts honed to a fine edge, allowing them to move silently through
    the dense undergrowth and strike with lethal precision. They are as comfortable swimming in the
    swamps and rivers as they are stalking through the jungle, making them frightening ambush
    predators.

    Violence is a central aspect of kodo culture, and they are highly prone to acts of aggression
    and bloodshed. Conflicts between tribes are frequent, often erupting over territory, resources,
    or personal slights. These skirmishes can be deadly, with the victors taking captives and
    resources from the defeated. The kodo's violent tendencies extend beyond inter-tribal warfare;
    within each tribe, individuals constantly vie for dominance, leading to a culture of suspicion
    and treachery.

    Cannibalism is a common practice among the kodo, driven by both necessity and ritual. In the
    harsh environment of Rajapun, food can be scarce, and the kodo see their fallen enemies and even
    weaker members of their own tribes as sources of sustenance. Cannibalism is also a means of
    asserting dominance, with the strongest consuming the flesh of their foes to gain their strength
    and power. This grisly practice reinforces the kodo's brutal social order and serves as a
    constant reminder of their savage origins.

    Despite their violent and bestial nature, the kodo are not without a sense of community and
    loyalty to their own kind. Within their tribes, they share a fierce bond, working together to
    hunt, gather, and protect their territory from outsiders. They have a deep connection to the
    land of Rajapun, seeing themselves as its rightful inhabitants and defenders. The kodo's unique
    blend of primal savagery and emerging societal structure makes them one of the most intriguing
    and dangerous inhabitants of Edda.
