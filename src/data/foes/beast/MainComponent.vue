    The wild beasts of Edda reflect the land's vast diversity, ranging from the familiar to the
    awe-inspiring. In most regions, the forests and plains are home to deer, boars, wolves, bears,
    and other creatures that sustain and challenge the people who live among them. Horses are a
    cornerstone of life in Edda, carefully bred for war, travel, and labor, while rivers teem with
    fish, and the skies are graced by great flocks of birds. These creatures, woven into the fabric
    of daily life, are essential to the survival and culture of Edda's many peoples.

    In the frozen north, the beasts grow larger and more ferocious, shaped by the harshness of their
    environment. Great woolly beasts with immense tusks roam the tundra, their dense coats providing
    protection against icy winds. Predatory cats with long, curved fangs hunt the snowy forests,
    while giant elk with sprawling antlers traverse the sparse woodlands. Even the wolves of the
    north are massive, traveling in packs that command respect and fear alike. These creatures,
    ancient and primal, have adapted perfectly to a land of unrelenting cold.

    On the great plains of the east, the beasts are vast and varied. Herds of bison and antelope
    graze the grasslands, their numbers so great that they can darken the horizon. Swift horses,
    bred for endurance and speed, are the pride of the Garradi, while massive bears and giant cats
    prowl the forests that border the plains. The people of the east have learned to live in harmony
    with these creatures, respecting their power and understanding their place in the natural order.

    The deserts of Ithra are home to creatures that are as deadly as they are beautiful. Serpents,
    scorpions, and other venomous creatures thrive in the arid landscape, their adaptations allowing
    them to survive in the harshest of conditions. Great birds of prey soar above the dunes, their
    keen eyesight and powerful talons making them formidable hunters. Even the plants of Ithra are
    dangerous, with thorns and spines that can pierce even the toughest of hides.

    On the tropical isle of Rajapun, the beasts are entirely different, their size and appearance
    unlike anything found elsewhere in Edda. Massive dragon-like lizards dominate the island, their
    sharp claws and powerful jaws making them the masters of this verdant realm. The land of Rajapun
    has been completely reclaimed by nature, following the plague of Akura, and the great beasts
    that roam there have been largely forgotten by the rest of Edda.

    Throughout Edda, wild beasts are more than mere animals; they often carry cultural or spiritual
    significance. In Wydmyn, wolves are seen as kin by the half-elven, while in Garrad, the raven is
    revered as a messenger of Po. Even in Unterlund, where the land is more tamed, noble stags are
    held in high regard and associated with religious symbolism. The people of Edda respect these
    creatures deeply, understanding that the balance of life and survival often depends on
    coexisting with them.

    In the most remote and untamed parts of Edda, whispers of extraordinary creatures persist.
    Serpents said to be large enough to encircle entire ships are rumored to dwell in the southern
    seas, while in the Copper Mountains, immense birds with wingspans wide enough to blot out the
    sun are said to make their nests. Whether these creatures are real or merely the stuff of
    legend, their tales fuel the imaginations of travelers and storytellers alike.

    The beasts of Edda, from the fierce predators of the icy north to the towering giants of
    Rajapun, embody the untamed power of the natural world. They are a constant reminder of the
    land's raw beauty and danger, shaping the lives, stories, and beliefs of those who inhabit this
    ever-changing world.
