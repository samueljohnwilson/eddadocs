    Elementals are beings of pure cosmic energy, inhabiting Astra, the primordial plane from which
    all other planes draw their essence. Created at the dawn of time by Enoreth, these beings are
    embodiments of the fundamental forces of nature: fire, water, earth, and air. Each elemental is
    a manifestation of its respective element, possessing immense power and a form that reflects its
    nature. In Astra, they exist in a state of perpetual flux, embodying the balance and chaos
    inherent in the cosmos.

    Fire elementals are fierce and untamed, their bodies composed of ever-shifting flames. They
    embody destruction, renewal, and passion, often seen as both creators and destroyers. In Astra,
    they reside in vast, fiery realms where molten rivers flow and volcanic eruptions are a
    constant. Their presence is both awe-inspiring and terrifying, capable of incinerating anything
    that crosses their path. Fire elementals are revered as symbols of energy and transformation,
    representing the raw power of creation and destruction.

    Water elementals, in contrast, are fluid and adaptable. They take forms reminiscent of oceans,
    rivers, and lakes, their bodies flowing seamlessly between states of matter. In Astra, they
    dwell in vast aquatic realms where the boundaries between liquid, solid, and gas are blurred.
    Water elementals are seen as nurturers and purifiers, essential for life and growth. They embody
    the principles of change, flexibility, and the cyclical nature of existence, flowing through the
    cosmos with an inherent grace and power.

    Earth elementals are steadfast and enduring, their forms comprised of rock, soil, and crystal.
    They inhabit the vast, mountainous regions of Astra, where the ground trembles with their
    movements. Earth elementals symbolize stability, strength, and resilience, often serving as the
    foundation upon which other forces act. They are the guardians of the physical world, their
    immense power capable of shaping landscapes and withstanding great force. Earth elementals
    represent the enduring nature of the cosmos, embodying the principles of solidity and
    permanence.

    Air elementals are ethereal and ever-changing, their forms composed of winds, storms, and
    breezes. In Astra, they soar through endless skies and tempestuous realms, their presence felt
    as both gentle zephyrs and fierce hurricanes. Air elementals symbolize freedom, intellect, and
    communication, representing the unseen forces that connect all things. They are messengers and
    guides, their movements shaping the weather and influencing the flow of information and ideas.
    Air elementals embody the principles of movement and transformation, constantly in flux yet
    always connected to the whole.

    Despite their distinct forms and characteristics, elementals share a common origin and purpose.
    In Astra, they exist in a delicate balance, their interactions shaping the very fabric of the
    plane. This balance is mirrored in the mortal realm, where elementals occasionally manifest,
    drawn by powerful magic or natural phenomena. When they do, their presence can bring both great
    benefit and tremendous destruction, reflecting the duality of their nature. Elementals are
    revered and feared in equal measure, seen as both allies and adversaries by those who encounter
    them.

    The elementals' connection to Astra makes them integral to the understanding of the cosmos.
    Scholars and mages study them to gain insight into the fundamental forces that govern existence.
    Their appearances in the mortal realm are often seen as omens or signs of significant events,
    their actions influencing the course of history. Elementals remind all beings of the raw,
    untamed power that underlies the universe, a power that is both awe-inspiring and humbling.
