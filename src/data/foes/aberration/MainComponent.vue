    Aberrations in Edda are beings that defy the natural order, existing outside the scope of
    Enoreth's creation. These creatures are often characterized by their nightmarish forms and alien
    mindsets, which make them utterly incomprehensible to mortal beings. Some aberrations are
    eternally ancient and mysterious entities, predating even the creation of the planes themselves.
    These primordial beings are remnants of a time before Enoreth wove the fabric of reality. Other
    aberrations are perversions of reality created by powerful magic. These warped creatures are
    often the unintended consequences of reckless spellcasting or dark experiments gone awry.

    Among the most terrifying aberrations are those that reside in void between the planes, in
    places untouched by the influence of Enoreth. These voidborn entities are drawn to the energy of
    the planes and often seek to infiltrate and corrupt them. Their motives are as inscrutable as
    their forms, and encounters with voidborn aberrations are rare but devastating, leaving madness
    and destruction in their wake. The voidborn are said to be driven by an insatiable hunger for
    the life force of the planes, consuming it to sustain their own unnatural existence.

    Those mages who dabble in forbidden magics risk unleashing these abominations upon the world.
    Such creatures often retain a twisted semblance of their original form, but with grotesque
    mutations and unnatural abilities that defy the laws of nature. These aberrations serve as grim
    reminders of the dangers of tampering with the fabric of reality.

    Some aberrations are native to the deepest, darkest corners of Edda, lurking in places where the
    veil between the planes is thin. These creatures thrive in environments where reality itself is
    unstable, such as the depths of the sea or deep below the surface of the earth. They are often
    highly intelligent and possess powers that allow them to manipulate their surroundings and prey
    on unsuspecting adventurers.

    There are also aberrations that result from curses or divine retribution, twisted into monstrous
    forms by the wrath of an Urdor or the spite of powerful beings. These cursed aberrations are
    often driven by a singular, obsessive purpose, whether it be revenge, protection of a sacred
    site, or the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. Their existence is a testament to the
    unpredictable and often cruel nature of the divine, as well as the far-reaching consequences of
    mortal actions that offend the gods.

    Despite their varied origins, all aberrations share a common trait: they are fundamentally alien
    to the natural world of Edda. Their presence is a blight upon the land, warping reality around
    them and spreading fear and chaos wherever they go. Heroes and scholars alike study these
    creatures with equal parts fascination and dread, seeking to understand their origins and find
    ways to protect the world from their influence. Confronting aberrations requires not just
    strength and courage, but also a deep understanding of the forces that lie beyond the known
    world, and the wisdom to recognize the boundaries of mortal comprehension.
