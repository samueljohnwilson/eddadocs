    Aberrations in Edda are beings that defy the natural order, existing outside the scope of
    Anoreth's creation. These creatures are often characterized by their nightmarish forms and alien
    mindsets, which make them utterly incomprehensible to mortal beings. Some aberrations are
    eternally ancient and mysterious entities, predating even the creation of the planes themselves.
    These primordial beings are remnants of a time before Anoreth wove the fabric of reality. Others
    among them are voidborn, creatures that emerged from the emptiness beyond the planes, untouched
    by the order of Anoreth.

    The motives of aberrations are shrouded in mystery, and their forms are unfathomable
    distortions, never quite conforming to any known physical laws. Places touched by these
    creatures are often permanently changed, sometimes twisted into warped versions of their
    original forms, where time and space feel unreliable and reality itself becomes unstable. These
    beings thrive in such conditions, and some are known to lurk in the deepest, darkest corners of
    Edda, in remote places where the fabric of reality is thinnest, and their influence is
    strongest. Whether in the depths of the oceans or buried below the earth, they thrive in areas
    where the natural order is weakest.

    In the ancient, hidden corners of Edda, it is rumored that these primordial aberrations hold
    secrets long lost to time, possibly the very knowledge of what lay before creation. Such
    mysteries tempt those who seek forbidden power, but few who delve into this knowledge return
    unscathed. Voidborn aberrations have a power that extends beyond mere physical destruction;
    their presence erodes minds, bringing madness, confusion, and an unsettling awareness of the
    worlds beyond. Scholars and adventurers alike approach these mysteries with caution, knowing
    that studying them risks unraveling one's own sanity. Legends tell that even the gods fear the
    touch of these creatures, for they are relics of a reality that lies beyond divine
    comprehension.

    Though few understand the full truth of these aberrations, all know that they exist in
    opposition to the life and order of Edda. Their very presence is a reminder that the universe is
    vast and complex, filled with entities that predate even the divine forces that shaped Edda's
    reality. Those who confront them face not just a physical battle, but a test of resolve against
    a terror that belongs to a time before time, and a force that defies comprehension itself.
