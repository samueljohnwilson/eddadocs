    Celestials are beings created by the collective will of the Asier, the benevolent gods who
    embody justice, wisdom, and creation. These radiant beings were formed from the pure essence of
    the Asier's combined power, symbolizing their unwavering commitment to upholding the divine laws
    set forth by their deities. Each celestial embodies the principles of the Asier, making them
    paragons of virtue and guardians of the divine order.
