    These beings served as intermediaries between Surad and the mortal realm,
    often guiding and protecting those who followed the path of righteousness.
    Celestials were revered for their wisdom and their role in maintaining
    cosmic order.

    Since the end of the Second Age, celestials have not been present on the
    mortal realm. While their absence is deeply felt, their legacy endures
    through the teachings and laws they left behind. Their loyalty to Surad
    remains absolute, and their actions are still a source of inspiration for
    many.
