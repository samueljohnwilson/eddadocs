    Dragons are among the most ancient and powerful beings ever to exist. Created by Anoreth
    during the First Age, these magnificent creatures were designed to embody the very essence of
    elemental power and balance. Each dragon was a force of nature unto itself, possessing immense
    strength, intelligence, and magical abilities. Only thirteen dragons were ever created, making
    them both incredibly rare and immensely influential in the shaping of the world during their
    time.

    Throughout the millennia, dragons played pivotal roles in the history of Edda. Their influence
    extended far beyond their physical might, as they were often seen as guardians of ancient wisdom
    and bearers of profound knowledge. The dragons' guidance helped shape early civilizations, and
    their presence was both revered and feared. Temples and shrines were built in their honor, and
    the most legendary heroes sought their counsel. However, the dragons' power also made them
    targets for those who sought to usurp their strength or eliminate their influence.

    The Great War marked a significant turning point in the fate of the dragons. As the conflict
    raged, dragons found themselves drawn into the fray. Their allegiances were as diverse as their
    elemental natures, with some siding with the forces of order, others with chaos, and a few
    remaining neutral. The war took a heavy toll on their numbers, and many dragons were slain in
    the cataclysmic battles that ensued. Their deaths were mourned by those who revered them, and
    their passing marked the end of an era.

    By the end of the Great War, the surviving dragons had withdrawn from the mortal realm. Whether
    they were driven into hiding by the relentless pursuit of those who coveted their power or chose
    seclusion as a means of preserving their dwindling kind, no one can say for certain. Some
    scholars speculate that the remaining dragons retreated to hidden lairs deep within the world's
    most inaccessible places, where they could live out their long lives in solitude. Legends speak
    of dragons slumbering in enchanted caves, beneath the roots of ancient mountains, or in the
    depths of the ocean, awaiting a time when they might return to the world.

    Despite their absence, the legacy of the dragons endures in the myths and legends of Edda. Their
    stories are told in the songs of bards, the tomes of scholars, and the whispered tales of
    adventurers. The places where dragons once roamed are often considered sacred or cursed, and
    artifacts believed to be connected to them are highly sought after. The awe and reverence that
    dragons inspire have not diminished over time, and many believe that their return is a harbinger
    of great change.

    In the present day, the possibility that dragons might still exist somewhere in the world fuels
    the imagination and ambition of many. Adventurers and treasure seekers scour the land for signs
    of their presence, hoping to uncover the secrets of these ancient beings. Some seek to harness
    the dragons' power, while others merely wish to glimpse their majestic forms. Whether any
    dragons truly remain in Edda is a mystery, but their influence continues to shape the world,
    reminding all of the ancient, primordial forces that once roamed the earth.
