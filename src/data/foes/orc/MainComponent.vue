  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Orcs are a grotesque manifestation of the ancient Illyum race, now twisted and deformed by the
    malevolent influence of darkness. Their forms are hunched and sinewy, bearing the scars of ages
    of servitude and the marks of their corrupted lineage. Their skin, once fair like that of their
    Elven cousins, now bears a sickly hue of gray or green, a testament to their fallen nature.
    Their faces are contorted into grimaces of hatred and malice, their eyes burning with a cruel
    intelligence that betrays their savage appearance. Fang-like teeth jut from their gaping maws,
    ready to rend flesh with savage efficiency. Many wield crude, jagged weapons, forged in the
    depths of dark forges and wielded with a proficiency born of endless conflict. Driven by an
    insatiable thirst for conquest and domination, orcs serve their dark masters with unwavering
    loyalty. They are the foot soldiers of the dark lords' armies, relentless in their pursuit of
    their will and utterly without mercy in battle. Fear is an alien concept to them, replaced
    instead by a primal instinct for survival and a savage joy in the chaos of combat.

    Their culture is deeply rooted in the worship of Ulat, whom they revere as the ultimate
    embodiment of strength and chaos. Rituals and ceremonies dedicated to Ulat are bloody and
    brutal, often involving acts of sacrifice and displays of dominance. Orc shamans, known as
    gruuth, act as intermediaries between the orcs and their god, channeling Ulat's destructive
    power to enhance their warriors in battle. These shamans are both feared and respected, their
    visions and prophecies guiding the tribe's actions and ensuring Ulat's dark will is carried out.

    Orcish warfare is notorious for its savagery and ferocity. Orc warriors
    are trained from a young age to embrace their inner rage and fight with reckless abandon. Their
    combat style is brutal and direct, favoring overwhelming force over finesse. Warriors often
    wield massive weapons, capable of cleaving through armor and bone with ease. Their fearsome
    battle cries, combined with their sheer physical prowess, make them a terror on the battlefield.
    Orcish warbands are a common sight in the borderlands, raiding and pillaging to sustain their
    clans and spread fear among their enemies.

    Despite their warlike nature, orcish society is not without its structure and order. Each clan
    is led by a warchief, a position earned through displays of strength, cunning, and the ability
    to command respect. The warchief's rule is absolute, but they must constantly prove their worth
    to maintain their position, often through feats of strength or successful raids. Below the
    warchief are various warlords and chieftains who lead smaller factions within the clan. This
    hierarchy ensures that only the strongest and most capable rise to positions of power,
    maintaining a constant state of readiness and vigilance.

    Over thousands of years, Ulat subtly guided the orcs towards darkness by appealing to the more
    primal and destructive aspects of their nature. This gradual transformation was marked by an
    increasing embrace of violence, hatred, and a relentless pursuit of power. As a result, orcish
    society is characterized by a brutal hierarchy where strength and cunning are paramount. The
    orcs are often found in the harshest and most desolate regions of Edda, where they have forged a
    harsh existence through sheer force and resilience.
