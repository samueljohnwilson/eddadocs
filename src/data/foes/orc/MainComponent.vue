    Overview

  <v-card-text>
    Orcs are a grotesque manifestation of the ancient Illyum race, now twisted and deformed by the
    malevolent influence of darkness. Their forms are hunched and sinewy, bearing the scars of ages
    of servitude and the marks of their corrupted lineage. Their skin, once fair like that of their
    Elven cousins, now bears a sickly hue of gray or green, a testament to their fallen nature.

    Their faces are contorted into grimaces of hatred and malice, their eyes burning with a cruel
    intelligence that betrays their savage appearance. Fang-like teeth jut from their gaping maws,
    ready to rend flesh with savage efficiency. Many wield crude, jagged weapons, forged in the
    depths of dark forges and wielded with a proficiency born of endless conflict.

    Driven by an insatiable thirst for conquest and domination, orcs serve their dark masters with
    unwavering loyalty. They are the foot soldiers of the dark lords' armies, relentless in their
    pursuit of their will and utterly without mercy in battle. Fear is an alien concept to them,
    replaced instead by a primal instinct for survival and a savage joy in the chaos of combat.
