  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Golin, the Hunstman</strong>, wields the untamed spirit of the wilds, a figure both
    revered and feared by those who live close to nature. He is depicted as a towering, rugged
    figure, clad in furs, his eyes gleaming with primal wisdom. He does not sit a throne, nor attend
    to a temple, apart from the boundless wilderness, where his presence is felt in the whisper of
    wind through the trees, the crack of a branch underfoot, and the deep, resonant calls of unseen
    beasts. To Golin, civilization is but a fleeting construct—true freedom lies in the embrace of
    the wild, where the strong and the swift thrive, and the slow and careless fall behind.

    Though Golin claims dominion over the wilds, he does not seek to tame or shape it—he embodies
    its raw and unpredictable essence. He is the patron of hunters and wanderers, of those who live
    by their wits and skill, honoring the balance between predator and prey. To Golin, the hunt is
    not merely about survival but about respect: the hunter must never take more than needed, must
    give thanks for the life taken, and must ensure the land is not stripped bare. Those who hunt
    wastefully, or who kill for vanity rather than necessity, earn his wrath.

    Golin is also a god of revelry and wild celebration. He teaches that life, though often harsh,
    should be savored. Feasts are held in his name, where the bounty of the hunt is shared among kin
    and clan, and stories are sung beneath open skies. It is said that on certain nights, under the
    full moon, Golin himself joins the wild revels, appearing in the form of a great stag or a
    spectral hunter leading a divine procession of fey spirits—the Wild Hunt. Those who witness it
    may be blessed with great fortune, or swept away to run with Golin's pack until dawn.

    His followers are as untamed as their god, a mix of hunters, rangers, and free spirits who
    reject the constraints of settled life. Many are wanderers who feel more at home beneath a
    canopy of stars than under a roof, and some are warriors who fight not for conquest, but to
    protect the wild places from encroaching civilization. Druids and shamans invoke his name to
    bless the hunt, while warriors seeking strength in battle may offer a portion of their meal to
    him before combat, believing that Golin grants his favor to those who live boldly and without
    fear.

    Despite his chaotic nature, Golin is not without wisdom. He understands that nature is both
    cruel and kind, that life is meant to be tested but also cherished. He values the bonds of
    kinship and the traditions of those who live off the land, and he despises those who seek to
    dominate nature rather than live in harmony with it. He is a guardian of balance—not through
    rigid law, but through the unspoken, eternal rules of the wild.

    Golin's followers are as untamed as the god they worship, embracing the freedom of the
    wilderness and rejecting the rigid structures of settled life. The half-elves of Wydmyn, hold
    Golin in special reverence. Their nomadic way of life aligns with his teachings, and they see
    the hunt not only as a means of survival but as a sacred duty, a way to honor the land that
    sustains them. Among the Wydmian, Golin is invoked before every hunt, and their hunters often
    carry charms shaped like antlers or fangs, believing these will grant them the swiftness and
    cunning of the Huntsman. Though their world has been shaped by war and hardship, they remain
    steadfast in their respect for the natural order, defending their lands with the ferocity of a
    wolf protecting its den.

    In the frozen north, the tundra dwarves of Hetheskein are also counted among Golin's most ardent
    followers. Unlike their mountain-dwelling kin, the tundra dwarves live without kings or rigid
    hierarchies, preferring the freedom of the open land, where survival is dictated by skill and
    cooperation rather than law and decree. Though they acknowledge Surad as their ancestral patron,
    many among them look to Golin as the embodiment of the wild strength they rely on to endure the
    brutal tundra. They move in loose-knit tribes, following the great herds and seeking shelter in
    glacial caves, their lives dictated by the rhythm of the land rather than the edicts of a ruler.
    These dwarves hold great feasts in Golin's name after every successful hunt, where nothing is
    wasted, and the entire tribe shares in the bounty. Though mountain dwarves often regard them as
    crude and undisciplined, the tundra dwarves take pride in their way of life, believing that they
    alone have remained true to the gods' intent—living free, without walls to bind them.

    Golin commands no army of celestial beings, nor does he keep an orderly court. Instead, he is
    surrounded by a host of beasts of myth and legend, creatures that defy civilization's attempts
    to name or control them. These spirits take many forms: a towering stag with antlers of oak, a
    great grizzled bear that speaks the common tongue, or a giant hawk that soars above the clouds.
    They are said to be Golin's messengers, appearing to guide those he favors—or to warn those who
    have trespassed against him. Some whisper that certain mortal hunters, those who have proven
    their worth in life, are chosen to run with Golin's pack in death, their spirits forever bound
    to the endless wilderness.
