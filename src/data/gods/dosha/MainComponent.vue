  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Dosha, the Gilded Hand</strong>, is the god of wealth, commerce, and prosperity. He is
    the patron of merchants, bankers, and those who seek fortune through trade and cunning. His
    domain is not merely gold and riches, but the flow of goods, the balance of agreements, and the
    trust that sustains economic exchange. Trade is the foundation upon which societies rise and
    fall, and Dosha ensures that this great engine continues to turn. Where markets thrive, where
    caravans cross vast distances, where contracts are honored and fortunes made, his influence is
    strongest. To worship Dosha is to understand that wealth is not static—it must be earned,
    invested, and set in motion.

    Yet Dosha does not reward greed for its own sake. He teaches that wealth is to be sought through
    fair dealings, strategic investment, and keen foresight, not through corruption or deceit. To
    him, profit is not a sin, but the natural outcome of skill and effort. However, those who
    disrupt trade—who hoard resources to starve markets, who break contracts for personal gain, who
    exploit rather than build—are condemned. He has little patience for those who mistake blind
    avarice for true prosperity.

    Dosha's teachings also extend beyond coin, for wealth is not merely measured in gold. Influence,
    knowledge, and opportunity are all forms of currency, and those who trade in them wisely may
    find themselves wealthier than any king. His faithful understand that wealth is power, and power
    is best wielded with discretion. Those who rise too quickly without the wisdom to temper their
    ambition often find themselves just as swiftly undone.

    Dosha's doctrine emphasizes that wealth is more than gold; it is knowledge, influence, and
    opportunity. A fair negotiation is as sacred as a prayer, a well-brokered deal as revered as an
    act of devotion. His faithful understand that fortune is earned through careful judgment, that
    trust is the foundation of trade, and that the reckless pursuit of riches without wisdom leads
    only to ruin. Those who seek his favor do not beg for riches—they seek the insight to see
    opportunities where others see obstacles, the patience to build something lasting, and the
    discipline to act with prudence rather than impulse.

    Though Dosha is a god of commerce, he is also the god of obligations. A contract made under his
    name is inviolable, and those who break their word risk not only mortal retribution but divine
    censure. He is invoked in all matters of trade, from the smallest bartered exchange to the
    grandest agreements between nations. His name is etched into the pillars of great trade halls
    and spoken before the signing of treaties, a reminder that the weight of a promise is measured
    not just in coin, but in the trust that sustains civilization itself.

    Dosha's worship is woven into the rhythms of commerce, and his festivals are grand celebrations
    of prosperity, trade, and the forging of new opportunities. Such festivals are times of
    negotiation, where rival traders are encouraged to settle disputes and forge alliances under the
    gaze of Dosha's priests. At night, feasts are held in his honor, where success is toasted, deals
    are finalized, and stories of great bargains and ventures are shared. These rituals reinforce
    Dosha's core teachings: that wealth must flow, trust must be honored, and fortune smiles upon
    those who act with wisdom and foresight.

    Dosha's faithful come from all walks of life, but they are most often found among merchants,
    bankers, traders, and financiers. Guilds and merchant houses construct temples in his honor,
    often doubling as banks or marketplaces where deals are struck under the watchful eye of his
    priests. His clergy are not beggars or ascetics—they are skilled negotiators, financial
    advisors, and shrewd businesspeople who understand that to worship Dosha is to engage in trade
    itself. Offerings to him often take the form of coin placed upon a merchant's scales or the
    first profit of a new venture. To show reverence, his followers often mark their ledgers and
    contracts with his sigil, ensuring that their dealings fall under his favor.

    The <strong>grey scribes</strong> are Dosha's tireless record-keepers, divine beings tasked with
    maintaining the Ledger—a vast and unfathomable record of all debts, transactions, and agreements
    made across the planes. They exist in the liminal space between law and fortune, their forms
    draped in spectral grey robes that shift like parchment in the wind. Each carries a parchment
    tome and stylus, with which they inscribe every contract, oath, and exchange into celestial
    tomes that are said to be kept in the Vault of Accounts, a grand hall within Dosha's domain.
    Silent and impartial, the scribes do not judge the morality of a transaction—only that it
    is recorded truthfully and whether all parties uphold their end of the bargain. They are privy
    to all manner of pacts, hearing them as whispers from across the planes. It is said that those
    who attempt to cheat Dosha's order—whether through fraud, broken contracts, or the refusal to
    settle debts—will find themselves silently judged by the scribes. The most grievous offenders,
    those who undermine the very fabric of trade, may see their names struck from the Ledger, an
    erasure that marks them as cursed, ensuring that fortune will never again smile upon their
    dealings.
