  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Lamnosh, the Unraveller,</strong> is the god of madness and chaos. He is the creeping
    voice in the dark, the flickering shadow at the edge of sight, the fevered dreams that claw at
    the mind. Where other gods shape the world through power and dominion, Lamnosh works in subtler,
    more insidious ways. He does not need armies, for his touch is felt in the quiet erosion of
    sanity, the whisper that makes a man doubt his own thoughts, the laughter that rings hollow in
    the face of horror. He is chaos given voice, disorder given form, and to hear his call is to
    stand upon the precipice of madness.

    Unlike some gods, Lamnosh does not welcome worship in the traditional sense. His influence seeps
    into the world like a plague, infecting the minds of the weak and the desperate. He delights in
    breaking the minds of the wise and unraveling the convictions of the devout. Those who hear his
    whispers often do not even know they serve him, mistaking their delusions for divine truth,
    their nightmares for prophecy. Cults dedicated to Lamnosh rise and fall like fever
    dreams—sometimes burning brightly in acts of shocking violence, other times lurking in the
    shadows, their members whispering secrets that unravel the fabric of sanity.

    Lamnosh's touch is especially dangerous when his madness festers in the minds of scholars,
    priests, and rulers alike. A single corrupted mind can spread chaos like wildfire, toppling
    empires and reducing great civilizations to ruin. Yet his influence is not limited to mortals—he
    whispers even to the gods, sowing discord among them, twisting intentions, and blurring the line
    between wisdom and folly. Some say that even the greatest among the divine have, at times, heard
    the voice of Lamnosh and shuddered at its implications.

    Though many would call him a god of destruction, Lamnosh does not seek ruin for its own sake. He
    does not crave power or dominion over others. Rather, he exists as the embodiment of unmaking,
    the force that breaks apart the structures mortals and gods alike have built. To him, madness is
    not a flaw but a truth—the world itself is a joke, a fragile illusion held together by the
    delusions of the sane. To see reality for what it truly is, one must abandon reason and embrace
    the whispering chaos that lies beneath.

    The most fervent followers of Lamnosh are rarely aware of their allegiance—they are those whose
    minds have been broken beyond repair. Some are prophets of insanity, speaking in riddles that
    sometimes—terrifyingly—come true. Others are wanderers, drawn to places where madness festers,
    spreading his influence without knowing why. Those few cults dedicated to Lamnosh are often
    small and short-lived due to the chaos they sow and the madness they embrace.

    The gibberers are the writhing spawn of Lamnosh, birthed from the nightmares of the
    deranged and the fractures in reality itself. These amorphous horrors slither and ooze, their
    glistening, ever-shifting flesh studded with malformed mouths that babble in a thousand
    discordant tongues, each voice a fragment of lost sanity. To hear their whispers is to invite
    madness—coherent thought unravels, reason dissolves, and reality distorts into a waking
    nightmare. The gibberers do not hunt in the traditional sense; they seep into the world's hidden
    cracks, drawn to places of despair and suffering, where their incessant murmuring seeps into the
    minds of the living, warping them into lunatic disciples of chaos. Those who stare too long into
    the depths of their quivering mass risk being devoured—not just in body, but in mind, their
    consciousness absorbed into the endless cacophony of madness.
