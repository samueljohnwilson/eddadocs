  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Valeya, the Light</strong>, is the ever-burning flame that drives away darkness and
    despair. She is a beacon of hope, compassion, and renewal, worshiped by those who seek to mend
    the broken and illuminate the path of righteousness. Her radiance is not merely the light of the
    sun but the warmth of mercy, the glow of wisdom, and the guiding flame that leads the lost home.
    Where others see the inevitability of suffering, Valeya sees the promise of restoration, for she
    believes that all wounds—of body, mind, and soul—can be healed with time and care.

    Though she is gentle, Valeya is not passive. She is a force of action, a goddess who demands
    that her followers bring light into the world rather than simply bask in it. To serve Valeya is
    to stand against cruelty, to shield the weak, and to challenge despair wherever it festers. She
    despises those who revel in suffering, and her wrath burns brightest against those who inflict
    harm upon the innocent. In times of war, she is the solace of the wounded, the hand that soothes
    agony and grants the strength to endure.

    Legends tell of Valeya's endless struggle against the gods of decay and malice. Nogloth's
    plagues seek to wither and break, but Valeya's touch restores. Lamnosh spreads madness and
    despair, but Valeya brings clarity and hope. Even Eth-Korel, the Queen of Death, finds her work
    undone by Valeya's power, for where others see a soul's end, Valeya sees a chance for renewal.
    Yet she does not seek to destroy these forces entirely—she understands that darkness has its
    place in the balance of existence. But as long as suffering endures, so too will her light shine
    in defiance.

    Valeya's presence is strongest where kindness flourishes. Her temples are sanctuaries of
    healing, where the sick and wounded are cared for without question. Her priests and priestesses
    are not only healers but also teachers, spreading knowledge of medicine and wisdom to those in
    need. Many see her as a motherly figure, endlessly patient and forgiving, but those who mistake
    her kindness for weakness soon learn that her light can burn as fiercely as the sun.

    She is also the goddess of revelation, of seeing truth beyond illusion. Her light dispels not
    only physical darkness but the shadows of ignorance and deceit. Those who seek enlightenment
    often pray to Valeya, believing that she will grant them clarity and wisdom. Her faithful
    believe that no lie can withstand her gaze, no falsehood can endure in her presence.

    Valeya's symbols are the rising sun, the open hand, and the golden flame. Her presence is
    invoked in times of hardship, her name whispered in the dark as a plea for hope. She is the last
    light in the abyss, the warmth in the cold, the quiet assurance that no matter how deep the
    night, dawn will always come.

  <v-card-text>
    The faithful of Valeya are healers, protectors, and seekers of truth. Her clerics and paladins
    walk the lands, dressed in golden robes, bringing aid to the sick, tending to the wounded, and
    rooting out suffering wherever it festers. They establish hospitals and waystations, offering
    refuge to the weary and nourishment to the hungry. Some dedicate their lives to medicine,
    becoming skilled physicians who combine divine magic with practical healing arts. Others take up
    arms, not as conquerors but as defenders, standing as shields against those who would bring harm
    to the innocent.

  <v-card-subtitle> VASSALS </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Valeya's divine servants are the seraphim, radiant beings of mercy and flame who act as her hands in the world.
    Manifesting as figures cloaked in blinding light, their wings shimmer with golden fire, and their voices carry the
    resonance of dawn breaking through darkness. Each seraphim is both healer and sentinel—ministering to the wounded
    with unmatched grace while standing as unyielding bulwarks against the forces of suffering and shadow. Though they
    rarely intervene directly, when they do appear in the mortal realm, it is often at moments of great crisis, bringing
    miraculous restoration to the afflicted and driving back horrors with the brilliance of their presence.

    The seraphim are not only agents of healing but also seekers of truth. They pierce illusions, dispel lies, and
    illuminate the hidden paths of righteousness. Their flame does not burn to destroy, but to reveal and to purify.
    Some say the most devout among Valeya's followers may glimpse a seraphim in dreams, guiding them toward their higher
    purpose. Others whisper that those who die in absolute service to light and mercy are gathered into Valeya's halls
    and reborn as seraphim themselves—eternal beacons of hope and compassion.
