  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Po, the Tempest, is a deity of chaos and unpredictability. She is a force of wild energy,
    embodying the ever-changing and capricious nature of the cosmos. Po is often depicted wreathed
    in swirling winds and crackling lightning, her laughter echoing across the skies like thunder.
    She holds sway over the turbulent forces of nature, her whims shaping the winds, rains, and
    storms that sweep across the mortal realm. She delights in stirring up chaos, reveling in
    unpredictability. Sailors pray to her for fair winds and calm seas, but they also fear her wrath
    when she unleashes her anger upon the oceans.

    In addition to her control over the elements, the Tempest is also the patron of games of chance
    and luck. She is worshipped by gamblers and risk-takers who seek her favor in games of dice,
    cards, and other contests of luck. Po's influence can be felt in the roll of the dice and the
    spin of the wheel, where fortune can shift in an instant, leaving jubilant winners and broken
    losers.

    Despite her reputation for chaos and unpredictability, the Tempest is not solely a destructive
    force. In her capriciousness, she also brings moments of great joy, excitement, and spontaneity to the
    planes. Her influence can be seen in the vibrant colors of a rainbow after a storm, in the
    thrill of a winning streak, and in the enchanting beauty of a moonlit dance under the stars. Po
    embodies the duality of chaos, both destructive and creative, reminding mortals that life is a
    wild and unpredictable journey filled with both challenges and opportunities.

    Initially uncommitted during the Great War, Po remained aloof as conflict ravaged the realms.
    However, as the forces of evil gained momentum, threatening to engulf the mortal realm in
    darkness, Po could no longer remain indifferent. In a dramatic shift, she joined forces with the
    Asier, recognizing the dire need for balance and upheaval against tyranny. As an army of orcs
    and allied humans attempted to cross Callum's Pass into Wydmyn, Po unleashed her fury, bringing
    forth a cataclysmic storm. Lightning crackled, winds howled, and torrents of rain lashed down,
    causing landslides that crushed vast swathes of the army and blocked the path for those that
    remained. The Retreat at Callum's Pass marked a decisive turning point in the war, as the tide
    of the war shifted in favor of the forces of light and order, thanks to the intervention of the
    capricious goddess and her elemental might.

    Among the fey, the Tempest is revered as a patron, embodying the spirit of their untamed nature.
    Fey creatures pay homage to her with offerings of song and dance, hoping to appease her
    mercurial nature and earn her favor in their mischievous endeavors. In return for their worship,
    Po bestows her blessings upon the fey, granting them the power to manipulate the elements and
    bend reality to their will. Fey creatures are often seen riding on the winds, calling forth
    storms, or weaving illusions with effortless grace. Like Po, they revel in chaos and
    unpredictability, seeing it as a source of inspiration and vitality.

    By definition, the followers of Po tend not to be organized in the traditional sense. Instead,
    they worship her in their own ways, often through acts of spontaneity, creativity, and
    risk-taking. Such an approach is epitomized by the shamans of Dal people of Garrad, known as
    Windlisteners. These mystical practitioners claim to hear whispers from Po carried upon the
    winds that sweep across the plains. They are attuned to the chaotic rhythms of nature,
    interpreting the subtle nuances of the of the rustling grasses and howling gales. The
    windlisteners serve as intermediaries between the mortal realm and the divine, channeling the
    wild energy of the Tempest to bring blessings, guidance, and even warnings to their people. They
    are respected and feared in equal measure, their enigmatic presence a reminder of the
    unpredictable and untamed forces that govern the world.

  <v-card-subtitle> Skremlings </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The skremling are a mischievous race of fey that epitomize the unpredictable nature of the
    Tempest. They can take nearly any form, but often appear as goblin-like humanoids or human
    children. Appearing in pairs, the skremling are often seen bickering and arguing amongst
    themselves as they haphazardly decide their next course of action. One moment they may be
    engaged in a heated debate, and the next they might burst into laughter or engage in a playful
    game of tag. Their actions are as unpredictable as the shifting winds, and mortals who are
    unfortunate enough to encounter them are often left bewildered by their erratic behavior.
    Despite their capricious nature, the skremling are not malicious creatures; they simply revel in
    the spontaneity and unpredictability of life, embodying the essence of the Tempest herself. That
    said, mortals must take great care when dealing with the skremling, as their pranks and tricks
    can have life-changing consequences.
