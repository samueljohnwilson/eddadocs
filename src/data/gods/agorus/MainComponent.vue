    In the early days of creation, Agorus played a crucial role in guiding mortals toward
    enlightenment. He was often depicted as a wise elder, imparting knowledge and understanding to
    those willing to learn. Legends tell of how he gifted the first astronomers with the knowledge

    However, Agorus' relationship with his brother Malak has always been fraught with tension. While
    Agorus embodies enlightenment and the pursuit of truth, Malak, the Devourer, represents
    destruction and chaos. Their conflicting natures have led to numerous clashes throughout the
    ages, with Agorus striving to counteract Malak's malevolent influence. Despite these struggles,
    Agorus remains steadfast in his mission to illuminate the minds of mortals and protect the
    sanctity of knowledge.
