    In the early days of creation, Agorus played a crucial role in guiding mortals toward
    enlightenment. He was often depicted as a wise elder, imparting knowledge and understanding to
    those willing to learn. Legends tell of how he gifted the first astronomers with the knowledge
    of the stars, taught the first healers the secrets of medicine, and inspired the first poets and
    philosophers. His influence was instrumental in the development of early civilizations, as his
    teachings helped shape societies built on the foundations of knowledge, justice, and harmony.

    The Gates of Agorus are a series of ancient portals created by Agorus, the All-Seer, during the
    tumultuous days of the Great War. Scattered across the lands of Edda, they allowed Agorus'
    followers to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye, providing a critical advantage in
    the conflict. Each Gate is a grand archway adorned with intricate celestial symbols and runes
    that glow with an otherworldly light. When activated, they shimmer with a brilliant, swirling
    energy that transports those who step through to another Gate, regardless of the distance.
    Although many of the Gates have since fallen into disrepair or been lost to time, the remaining
    ones are fiercely guarded and revered as sacred relics of a bygone era, symbols of Agorus'
    boundless wisdom and power.

  <v-card-text>
    Agorus' followers include magi, scholars, and mystics. They are the ones who seek to understand
    the deeper truths of existence. Ithra is home to many of Agorus' most ardent followers. In the
    arid expanses of the desert realm, the Farsirs, an esteemed order of mages, dedicate their lives
    to the worship and teachings of the All-Seer. Renowned for their profound wisdom and mastery of
    divination, the Farsirs harness the arcane energies of the desert to peer into the past,
    present, and future. Their secluded citadel, the Acumenium, is the center of magical knowledge
    in Edda. This prestigious institution is renowned for its student's unparalleled skill in
    divination and prophecy. The Farsirs tap into the arcane energies of the cosmos to unveil hidden
    truths and foresee future events, using their knowledge to guide Ithra's leaders and the people
    of Eddaâ€”when they choose to listen. Only 24 students are accepted into the Acumenium each
    year, and those who graduate become revered seers and advisors, sought after by rulers and
    scholars alike.

    Agorus' vassals are varied, but they all share a deep connection to the pursuit of knowledge and
    understanding. The most notable of his vassals are the strix, a race of celestial beings that
    take the form of owls. The strix are deeply intertwined with the worship of Agorus. These
    ethereal creatures are said to be the embodiment of Agorus' wisdom and vigilance, appearing on
    the mortal plane as messengers and guardians of knowledge. With feathers that shimmer like
    starlight and eyes that reflect the cosmos, the strix are both awe-inspiring and enigmatic. Long
    ago, they would grace the night skies above temples and sanctuaries dedicated to Agorus, their
    haunting calls resonating like an ancient, sacred chant. Scholars and sages believe that the
    strix possess the ability to see beyond the veil of reality, offering guidance and insight to
    those deemed worthy. Encountering a strix is considered a profound omen, signaling that Agorus
    himself is watching over and bestowing his celestial wisdom upon the fortunate recipient.
