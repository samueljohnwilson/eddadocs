  <v-card-subtitle> Overview </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Bargon, the Lord of Chains</strong>, is the god of oppression, punishment, and absolute
    order. He is the iron hand that enforces submission, the unyielding force that crushes
    rebellion, and the architect of suffering for those who defy his will. He rules over Ursh, a
    desolate and nightmarish realm within Mora, the plane of the Malor, where the souls of the
    damned are condemned to eternal torment. In Ursh, the wails of the punished echo ceaselessly as
    the minions of Bargon—his enforcers and torturers—carry out his divine decree. Unlike gods who
    rule through faith or inspiration, Bargon's dominion is rooted in fear, for all who cross him
    know that his grasp extends beyond death itself.

    Bargon's rule is intertwined with that of Eth-Korel, the goddess of death and the pitiless
    keeper of the dead. She does not merely shepherd souls—she harvests them, dragging the condemned
    to the Gates of Ursh with a grim satisfaction. There is no compassion in her judgment, no mercy
    in her embrace; she delivers souls to Bargon not out of duty, but out of malice. Together, they
    ensure that the wicked, the defiant, and even those who simply fall afoul of the divine order
    are bound in chains for eternity. In Ursh, the damned do not simply suffer—they are reshaped,
    reduced to hollow remnants of their former selves, stripped of identity and will until they are
    nothing but instruments of Bargon's endless dominion.

    Despite his monstrous nature, Bargon is not mindless in his cruelty. His rule is a precise and
    methodical machine, a perfect system of control designed to purge chaos and enforce absolute
    order. He is not a god of senseless destruction—he is a god of calculated, inexorable suffering.
    Some argue that his existence is necessary, a force that ensures no crime goes unpunished, no
    transgression without consequence. To his most devout followers, Bargon is not a figure of evil,
    but of justice—a god who understands that suffering is the price of stability, and that only the
    strong have the right to shape the world.

    For the wretched and the enslaved, however, Bargon is the shadow that looms over all existence.
    His is the god of the whip, the overseer of despair, the eternal master of the broken. The souls
    who fall into his grasp do not merely suffer; they are unmade and reforged as cogs in his
    infernal machine. His dominion stretches across the planes, for as long as power exists, so too
    does the will to subjugate. Revolts have risen in defiance of his rule, countless heroes have
    sought to break his chains, but Bargon endures, as unshakable as the iron walls of Ursh.

    Even among the gods, Bargon is a presence of terror. His alliance with Eth-Korel is unholy and
    absolute—she claims the dead, and he ensures they never escape their torment. When the Gates of
    Ursh swing open to receive another soul, there is no plea, no bargaining, no salvation. There is
    only the unrelenting grasp of the Lord of Chains, and the eternity of suffering that awaits
    within.

    Bargon's influence spreads far beyond his realm. He is the patron of tyrants, warlords, and
    slavers, those who impose their will upon the weak and see cruelty as a means of control. His
    priests do not merely teach submission—they enforce it, ensuring that the strong rule
    unchallenged and that rebellion is crushed before it can take root. To them, suffering is the
    natural state of existence, the mechanism by which order is maintained. They preach that all who
    resist authority are doomed to the torments of Ursh, a fate worse than any mortal punishment.

    Many of Bargon's worshippers are drawn by the grim power he wields. During the Great War, the
    March of the Damned was a nightmare made real, a moment when the gates of Ursh yawned open and
    spilled forth an army of the tormented dead. Clad in rusted chains and wrapped in their own
    agony, they marched without voice or will, an unstoppable tide of suffering and malice. Their
    touch brought the cold certainty of the grave, and with every battlefield they crossed, their
    ranks swelled as the fallen were shackled into their ranks. No blade could banish them, no force
    could resist them, and before their relentless advance, mortal armies crumbled in despair. For
    some, the promise of eternal dominion is a seductive lure, one that whispers of the power to
    reshape the world in chains of iron and bone.

  <v-card-subtitle> Vassals </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Gaolers are the dread pit fiends who serve as Bargon's highest enforcers within Ursh, overseeing
    the torment of the damned. Towering and clad in blackened iron, their bodies are wreathed in
    smoldering chains. Each Gaoler commands a host of lesser devils, ensuring that no soul escapes its
    rightful torment, and that every punishment is carried out with cruel efficiency. They are not
    mindless brutes but cunning tormentors, delighting in the artistry of suffering and the breaking
    of wills. Their mere presence is enough to drive lesser beings to despair, for their eyes burn
    with the cold fire of absolute dominion, and their voices carry the weight of unbreakable law.
    To face a Gaoler is to know the futility of resistance, for their power is second only to Bargon
    himself, and in Ursh, their word is law.
