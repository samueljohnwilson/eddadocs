  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Eth-Korel, the Duskfall</strong>, is a figure of malevolence and darkness whose presence
    casts a shadow across the planes of existence. She is a queen of evil, her dominion extending
    over realms steeped in despair and corruption. Eth-Korel's influence knows no bounds, her name
    whispered in fear by those who dare to speak of her vile deeds. She is a master of manipulation
    and intrigue, weaving webs of deceit and treachery to further her own twisted ambitions.

    Eth-Korel is indelibly associated with death, oppression, and authoritarianism. As the
    embodiment of these dark forces, she thrives on the suffering and subjugation of souls, her
    power rooted in the despair and hopelessness of the oppressed. To Eth-Koral, death is not just
    an end but a tool of control, used to enforce her unyielding will and crush any semblance of
    resistance. Authoritarian in nature, Eth-Korel's rule is absolute, demanding unwavering
    obedience and loyalty, with severe punishments meted out to those who dare defy her. Her
    influence perpetuates a cycle of fear and domination, casting a long shadow over the hearts and
    minds of those unfortunate enough to fall under her sway.

    She reigns over the desolate realm of Ursh within Mora, the plane of the Malor. Her domain is a
    grim landscape shrouded in perpetual twilight, where jagged mountains loom like silent sentinels
    over barren plains and winding rivers of molten lava. Within this bleak expanse, the souls of
    the damned are condemned to eternal torment, their anguished cries echoing through the ashen
    skies. These souls are subjected to unimaginable suffering, their very essence twisted and
    corrupted by the malevolent power of Eth-Korel. Each soul is bound to its own unique torment,
    tailored to reflect the sins and transgressions committed in life.

    Some are chained to the jagged rocks, their bodies eternally scorched by the molten rivers that
    flow beneath them, while others are hunted relentlessly by infernal beasts, never able to escape
    their tormentors. In the deepest pits of Ursh, souls are forced to relive their darkest moments,
    trapped in an unending cycle of guilt and despair. Eth-Korel's twisted minions, including the
    fearsome Ulwraiths, enforce her will, ensuring that no soul escapes the torment prescribed to
    them.

    The Godsdeath was particularly painful for Eth-Korel, due to her insatiable desire for power and
    domination. Since her banishment to Mora, Eth-Korel has sought to influence the mortal realm
    from afar through manipulation. She possesses a seductive allure, drawing unsuspecting mortals
    into her web with promises of power and forbidden knowledge. Many have been lured to her side,
    their souls ensnared by her dark enchantments, doomed to serve her for eternity.

  <v-card-text>
    Followers of the Malor cannot form religions openly in most regions of Edda. Accordingly,
    Eth-Korel is worshipped in shadows, by cultists who seek to harness her dark power for their own
    nefarious ends. She is a figure of dread and reverence, her name invoked in dark rituals and
    twisted prayers. Those who serve her are granted dark gifts and forbidden knowledge, their souls
    bound to her will for eternity. Eth-Korel's influence extends beyond the mortal realm, her dark
    energy seeping into the fabric of reality and corrupting all that it touches.

    Witches invoke the name of Eth-Korel in their twisted prayers and incantations. They see her as
    a patroness of the occult, a dark queen whose power and malevolence inspire both fear and
    reverence. In their secret covens and shadowy sanctums, witches offer sacrifices and perform
    rituals in her name, seeking to channel her dark energy and unlock forbidden secrets. They
    beseech the Duskfall for guidance, power, and favor, believing that by aligning themselves with
    her dark forces, they can achieve mastery over the arcane and bend reality to their will.
    Eth-Korel, in turn, looks upon these practitioners with a twisted kind of approval, seeing in
    them kindred spirits who share her thirst for power and domination.

  <v-card-subtitle> Ulwraiths </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The Ulwraiths, sinister and shadowy beings, are believed to be the harbingers of death, scouring
    the mortal plane at the behest of Eth-Korel in search of souls to claim. It is said that they
    materialize from the depths of the abyss, their presence heralded by a chilling whisper of dread
    that freezes the blood of those who encounter them. The Ulwraiths are relentless in their
    pursuit, hunting down the souls of the living with ruthless efficiency, their unearthly wails
    echoing through the night as they drag their victims into the depths of the abyss. It is
    whispered that once a soul is claimed by an Ulwraith, it is forever lost to the light, condemned
    to an eternity of torment in the darkest depths of Ursh.
