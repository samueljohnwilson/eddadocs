  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Eth-Korel, the Duskfall</strong>, is the cold and merciless goddess of death, keeper of
    endings, and eternal warden of the dead. To mortals, she is the chill at the back of the neck,
    the silence in the grave, the final word spoken in a voice of iron law. She does not grant
    mercy, only inevitability, and she suffers no resistance to the path she lays for all things.
    Her realm is not one of rest, but of rigid finality—death not as peace, but as bondage. Clad in
    robes of funereal black and veiled in pale silver, her gaze is said to draw the breath from the
    lungs and the warmth from the soul. No soul escapes her design; no fate eludes her hand.

  <v-card-text>
    Eth-Korel is indelibly associated with death, oppression, and finality. As the embodiment of
    these dark forces, she thrives on the suffering and subjugation of souls, her power rooted in
    the despair and hopelessness of the oppressed. To Eth-Korel, death is not just an end but a tool
    of control, used to enforce her unyielding will and crush any semblance of resistance.
    Authoritarian in nature, Eth-Korel's rule is absolute, demanding unwavering obedience and
    loyalty, with severe punishments meted out to those who dare defy her. Her influence perpetuates
    a cycle of fear and domination, casting a long shadow over the hearts and minds of those
    unfortunate enough to fall under her sway.

    All souls of the dead pass through <strong>Ethera</strong>, the ethereal plane, upon death.
    There, it is Eth-Korel who awaits them, gathering their spirits in grim silence. She bears them
    across the threshold between life and death, delivering each soul to
    <router-link to="/gods/thal">Thal, the Last Judge</router-link>, for final judgment. This is her
    sacred duty: to ensure that no soul lingers where it does not belong. She takes no joy in the
    process, only grim satisfaction in the inevitability of her purpose. Once Thal delivers his
    verdict, the righteous are granted peace in Eya, aside the radiant goddess
    <router-link to="/gods/valeya">Valeya</router-link>, while the unworthy are consigned to Mora,
    where <router-link to="/gods/bargon">Bargon</router-link> awaits with chains.

    Eth-Korel also reigns over the desolate realm of <strong>Ursh</strong> within Mora, the plane of
    the <strong>Malor</strong>. Her domain is a grim landscape shrouded in perpetual twilight, where
    jagged mountains loom like silent sentinels over barren plains and winding rivers of molten
    lava. Within this bleak expanse, the souls of the damned are condemned to eternal torment, their
    anguished cries echoing through the ashen skies. These souls are subjected to unimaginable
    suffering, their very essence twisted and corrupted by the malevolent power of Eth-Korel. Each
    soul is bound to its own unique torment, tailored to reflect the sins and transgressions
    committed in life.

  <v-card-text>
    Some are chained to the jagged rocks, their bodies eternally scorched by the molten rivers that
    flow beneath them, while others are hunted relentlessly by infernal beasts, never able to escape
    their tormentors. In the deepest pits of Ursh, souls are forced to relive their darkest moments,
    trapped in an unending cycle of guilt and despair. Eth-Korel's twisted minions enforce her will,
    ensuring that no soul escapes the torment prescribed to them.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-text>
    Though she speaks rarely, when she does, even her foes fall silent. Her will is not made in
    passion, but in decree. To resist her is not to fight death—it is to commit blasphemy against
    the oldest law of all. And for that, there is only one sentence. Eth-Korel's justice is not
    arbitrary or cruel; it is absolute. Her cruelty lies in her indifference, and in her belief that
    compassion is weakness that must be excised from the world like rot from flesh.
  </v-card-text>
  <v-card-text>
    In the end, there is only the Duskfall. When cities fall, when kings perish, when the last ember
    of hope dies, Eth-Korel waits. And whether in whispered prayer or screaming defiance, all mortal
    voices will one day speak her name.

  <v-card-subtitle> WORSHIPPERS </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Followers of the Malor cannot form religions openly in most regions of Edda. Accordingly,
    Eth-Korel is worshipped in shadows, by cultists who seek to harness her dark power for their own
    nefarious ends. She is a figure of dread and reverence, her name invoked in dark rituals and
    twisted prayers. Those who serve her are granted dark gifts and forbidden knowledge, their souls
    bound to her will for eternity. Eth-Korel's influence extends beyond the mortal realm, her dark
    energy seeping into the fabric of reality and corrupting all that it touches.

  <v-card-text>
    Witches invoke the name of the Duskfall in their twisted prayers and incantations. They see her
    as a patroness of the occult, a dark queen whose power and malevolence inspire both fear and
    reverence. In their secret covens and shadowy sanctums, witches offer sacrifices and perform
    rituals in her name, seeking to channel her dark energy and unlock forbidden secrets. They
    beseech the Duskfall for guidance, power, and favor, believing that by aligning themselves with
    her dark forces, they can achieve mastery over the arcane and bend reality to their will.
    Eth-Korel, in turn, looks upon these practitioners with a twisted kind of approval, seeing in
    them kindred spirits who share her thirst for power and domination.

  <v-card-subtitle> VASSALS </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    First among Eth-Korel's vassals are the <strong>Ulwraiths</strong>, the harbingers of death.
    They scour the mortal plane in search of souls to claim. It is said that they materialize from
    the depths of the abyss, their presence heralded by a chilling whisper of dread that freezes the
    blood of those who encounter them. The Ulwraiths are relentless in their pursuit, hunting down
    the souls of the living with ruthless efficiency, their unearthly wails echoing through the
    night as they drag their victims into the depths of the abyss. It is whispered that once a soul
    is claimed by an Ulwraith, it is forever lost to the light, condemned to an eternity of torment
    in the darkest depths of Ursh.
