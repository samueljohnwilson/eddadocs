  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Othar, the Red God</strong>, is the embodiment of war in its purest form—neither
    righteous nor cruel, but an unstoppable force that shapes the fate of mortals and gods alike. He
    is chaos given steel, the roar of battle, and the relentless march of warriors into the fray.
    Othar does not favor conquerors or defenders, nor does he concern himself with honor or
    treachery. To him, war is an ever-turning wheel, a force that must be embraced, understood, and
    wielded by those strong enough to survive its trials. He is often depicted as a figure clad in
    mismatched armor, red with the blood of a thousand battles.

    Unlike those who seek to impose order or justify bloodshed with ideals, Othar is a patron of raw
    conflict, where strength and cunning reign supreme. He is followed by warbands, mercenaries, and
    raiders who do not fight for kings or causes but for the thrill of battle itself. To them, Othar
    is the truest expression of freedom—an existence unbound by law, where only the clash of steel
    and the test of will matter. His worshippers see war as an eternal state of being, one that can
    never be tamed, only endured.

    While some view Othar as a reckless and destructive force, he is not a mindless agent of ruin.
    He does not seek to spread war for its own sake, nor does he revel in suffering as others might.
    Instead, he acknowledges that conflict is inevitable, a necessary cycle that forges both
    individuals and civilizations. In this way, he is a paradox—an agent of chaos who upholds the
    natural course of existence. Those who invoke his name do not pray for peace, nor for victory,
    but simply for the strength to fight another day.

    In battle, Othar's presence is felt in the surge of adrenaline, the instinct to strike or
    defend, the moment when all thought falls away, and only action remains. He favors warriors who
    fight on their own terms, who refuse to be bound by duty or tradition. His blessing does not
    come in the form of protection but in the relentless drive to push forward, to test one's
    limits, to embrace the uncertainty of the battlefield.

    Though warlords and marauders often claim to fight in his name, Othar cares little for boasts
    and banners. His favor is won through struggle, his presence felt in the chaos of battle. To
    worship Othar is not to seek his guidance but to embrace war itself—to wield it, to master it,
    and to understand that in the end, only the strong endure.

  <v-card-subtitle> WORSHIPPERS </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Othar's followers are those who live by the sword, driven by a thirst for conflict, glory, and
    the freedom that only battle can provide. His devotees include mercenaries, warlords, brigands,
    rebel fighters, and anyone who thrives in the chaos of war. These followers are often
    independent, unwilling to submit to the authority of kings or nations, seeing themselves as free
    spirits bound only by their own strength and will. Many of Othar's worshippers belong to nomadic
    tribes, raiding bands, or outlaw groups, fighting not for land or treasure but for the right to
    live as they choose. Central to his faith are his war priests, charismatic figures who lead
    their followers with a combination of divine inspiration and brutal pragmatism. These priests do
    not preach traditional doctrines of peace or morality, but instead offer their blessings to
    those who engage in battle, calling upon Othar to bestow strength, courage, and victory. Their
    rituals are often performed on the battlefield, where they invoke Othar's chaotic power to turn
    the tide of war, and they lead their warriors with a single-minded focus on achieving victory
    through strength. Though their motives vary, all of Othar's followers share a common belief in
    the sanctity of struggle—the idea that true strength is earned on the battlefield, not in
    courtrooms or councils. These devotees are seen as wild and unpredictable, their devotion to
    Othar inspiring both fear and respect wherever they roam.

  <v-card-subtitle> VASSALS </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Othar's divine servants, known as the reavers, are the relentless enforcers of his chaotic will,
    embodying the fury and brutality of war itself. These divine warriors, clad in battered armor
    and wielding weapons etched with the scars of a thousand battles, exist solely for conflict.
    They are born of blood and iron, emerging from the chaos of battle to serve as Othar's
    champions. They are not bound by the constraints of mortality, existing in a state between life
    and death. Though they serve no master but Othar, they are bound to his endless struggle, compelled
    by an insatiable hunger for bloodshed and the belief that only through conflict can true
    strength be found.
