    <strong>Bayah, the Hearthmother</strong>, is the gentle yet steadfast guardian of home and
    hearth. She is revered by farmers, herdsmen, and all who cultivate the land or tend to the
    warmth of the home. She represents not only the bounty of the fields but also the bonds of
    kinship, the comfort of a well-tended fire, and the strength found in community. Though she is a
    nurturing deity, providing for those who toil with honest labor, she does not abide laziness or
    waste. The gifts of the earth are meant to be earned and cherished, and those who take more than
    their share risk falling out of her favor.

    Unlike wilder gods who embody the untamed aspects of nature, Bayah values careful stewardship
    above all. She teaches that the land, though bountiful, must be nurtured and respected, lest it
    withhold its riches. She is the patron of those who plant and reap, who tend animals, and who
    sustain their families through patience and diligence. The first fruits of every harvest are
    often offered to her in gratitude, a recognition that prosperity is never guaranteed without the
    cooperation of soil, rain, and toil.

    The Hearthmother's influence extends beyond the fields and into the the home. She is invoked
    over the first fire in a new dwelling, and many households maintain small altars to her, adorned
    with fresh bread, dried herbs, or simple tokens of gratitude. She watches over families,
    ensuring that love and warmth endure even in the harshest of times. Though she does not meddle
    in mortal disputes, those who violate the sanctity of home and family—through treachery, greed,
    or cruelty—may find their fortunes withering like an untended crop.

    Though kind, Bayah is not weak. She is as firm as the plow cutting through earth, as enduring as
    the ancient traditions passed down through generations. In times of famine or hardship, her
    followers pray for her mercy, and she answers those who have been faithful stewards of the land.
    But when communities turn against one another, hoard grain while others starve, or defile the
    sanctity of hearth and home, she withholds her blessings, letting them reap the consequences of
    their own selfishness.

    During the Great War, Bayah's blessings became the lifeblood of the armies of righteousness,
    sustaining them in their darkest hours. As battlefields burned and farmlands were trampled under
    the weight of war, it was the Hearthmother's touch that ensured the harvest did not fail
    entirely, that grain stores held longer than they should, and that the bread in soldiers' packs
    remained unblemished by mold. In besieged cities, where starvation loomed, prayers to Bayah saw
    roots and wild herbs flourish in hidden places, and livestock bear young despite the strain of
    war. Her faithful worked tirelessly, harvesting, baking, and tending to the wounded, their
    simple acts of nurture proving as vital as any blade or spell. Though she did not wield the
    storm or the sword, Bayah's quiet strength endured, ensuring that those who stood against
    darkness did not falter from hunger or despair.

    Her festivals revolve around planting and harvest, marked by feasts where communities gather to
    share in the bounty of their work. It is said that those who open their tables to the hungry on
    these days are blessed with good fortune, while those who turn others away may find their stores
    spoiled or their livestock barren in the seasons to come.

    Bayah's followers are many, ranging from humble farmers to skilled artisans who work with the
    fruits of the land—millers, brewers, cheesemakers, and potters. Even rulers and warlords respect
    her, for no kingdom can stand without sustenance. Her clergy often oversee communal feasts,
    preaching the values of diligence, charity, and the unbreakable bond between land and people.

    Brounies are the most well-known servants of Bayah—small, unseen fey that dwell in homes, barns,
    and fields, contributing the smooth running of daily life. Brounies are exceptionally rare, and
    those lucky enough to be visited by a brouny would do well to show their gratitude. They are
    said to be no taller than a child, with wiry frames and eyes that gleam like embers in the
    hearth. Ever industrious, brounies sweep floors, mend broken tools, churn butter, and chase away
    pests from the grain stores. They show their favour to those who keep a clean home and work
    diligently, but will abandon any who grow slothful or ungrateful. Tradition holds that leaving a
    fresh loaf of bread, a bowl of milk, or a warm blanket by the fire will earn a brouny's favor.
    Though mischievous at times, especially to the lazy, the brounies are ultimately benevolent
    beings, ensuring that hearths remain warm, larders full, and the harvest plentiful in Bayah's
    name.
