    Anoreth, the Great Weaver, is the primordial force that existed before the dawn of time, the
    essence from which all creation sprang forth. In the ancient tongues of Edda, Anoreth is revered
    as the eternal and omnipresent deity, a being of infinite wisdom and boundless power. It is said
    that Anoreth's very essence permeates the fabric of the universe, weaving the intricate patterns
    of existence and infusing all that is with its divine presence.

    Long before the first stars ignited in the vast expanse of the cosmos, there was only Anoreth, a
    singular, formless presence in the void. Anoreth was both the creator and the creation, an
    endless wellspring of potential and possibility. In the primordial silence, Anoreth began the
    great work of weaving the tapestry of reality, spinning threads of light and shadow, time and
    space, life and death.

  <v-card-subtitle> The Weaving </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    Anoreth's act of creation was an act of profound artistry and wisdom. With each weave of the
    cosmic loom, Anoreth brought forth new realms and dimensions, each thread a unique aspect of
    existence. From these threads, the world of Edda was born. Mountains, oceans, forests, and skies
    were all woven from the essence of Anoreth, imbued with the divine spark of life.

    To fill the world with life, Anoreth separated four parts from itself; each part was then split
    in two. From the first part were born
    <RouterLink to="/gods/surad">Surad, the First King</RouterLink>, and
    <RouterLink to="/gods/ulat">Ulat Banor, the Maelstrom</RouterLink>. From the second part came
    <RouterLink to="/gods/agorus">Agorus, the All-Seer</RouterLink>, and
    <RouterLink to="/gods/malak">Malak, the Lord of Lies</RouterLink>. From the third part came
    <RouterLink to="/gods/ura">Ura, the Dawnbringer</RouterLink>, and
    <RouterLink to="/gods/eth-korel">Eth-Korel, the Duskfall</RouterLink>. From the fourth came
    <RouterLink to="/gods/thal">Thal, the Arbiter</RouterLink>, and
    <RouterLink to="/gods/po">Po, the Everstorm</RouterLink>. Separately, the benevolent powers are
    known as the <strong>Asier</strong>, and the malevolent as the <strong>Malor</strong>. Together,
    they are the <strong>Urdor</strong>. The balance of their constructive and destructive forces
    allowed for the cycles of nature and the existence of life.

    Throughout the annals of time, Anoreth has maintained a stance of divine impartiality, not
    intervening directly in mortal affairs. However, history records two instances where Anoreth's
    hand reached into the realm of mortals. The first occurred during the Schism when the
    Illyum were cast away from Ulwyll, their ancestral home, as a means to restore balance to the
    world. Millennia later, at the culmination of the Great War, Anoreth enacted a momentous decree
    known as the Godsdeath. In this act, the Urdor were banished from the mortal realm, their
    influence waning as they were cast into the depths of the cosmos. These rare interventions serve
    as stark reminders of Anoreth's omnipotence and the delicate equilibrium it seeks to preserve
    within the tapestry of existence.

    Though Anoreth divided itself to create the Urdor, it remains ever-present in the world of Edda.
    Its essence flows through every living being, every stone, every breath of wind. Those attuned
    to the mystical arts can sense the presence of Anoreth in the world around them, drawing upon
    its infinite wisdom and power to shape the world and commune with the divine.

  <v-card-subtitle> Worshippers </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    In Edda, only a select few revere Anoreth, as most cultures have long forgotten the ancient
    creator. Temples dedicated to the Great Weaver are rare and hidden from the eyes of most,
    adorned with intricate tapestries and mosaics that depict the creation of the world and the
    divine balance maintained by the Urdor. Few are aware of Anoreth's true nature; only elves,
    druids, and ancient creatures remember the primordial deity in their prayers. Druids, referred
    to amongst themselves as Weavers, are elusive figures who dedicate their lives to understanding
    and preserving the intricate patterns of existence woven by their deity. They serve as
    intermediaries between the mortal realm and the divine, guiding the faithful few in their quest
    for harmony and enlightenment.

    Anoreth's story is one of infinite creation, a reminder that all things are interconnected, and
    that the essence of the divine flows through the very fabric of reality. In the world of Edda,
    the legacy of the Great Weaver endures, an eternal testament to the power of creation and the
    enduring balance of the cosmos.

  <v-card-subtitle> The Elementals </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    In the cosmology of Edda, the elemental beings that inhabit the plane of
    <strong>Astra</strong> are seen by some as being directly linked to Anoreth. These ethereal
    entities, embodiments of the primal forces of nature, are believed to be manifestations of
    Anoreth's divine essence, shaped by its will and infused with its power. From fiery beings that
    dance amidst flames to serene entities that ride currents of air, each elemental being reflects
    a facet of Anoreth's boundless creativity and unfathomable wisdom.
