    After Eos began to populate the world with humanoid creations, Surad
    offered them his knowledge, acting as a civilizing force for the denizens
    of Edda. For a time, he walked among the first men, serving as a guide and
    leader. For this reason, he is remembered among humans as The First King.

    Surad is rarely roused to anger, but the justice he metes out can be
    perceived as brutal. His devotees are known for their dispassionate
    adherence to law.
