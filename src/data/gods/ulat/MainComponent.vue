    <strong>Ulat, the Maelstrom</strong>, is the god of destruction, embodying the raw and unbridled
    forces of chaos and annihilation. Unlike the more calculated malevolence of his brother Malak,
    Ulat's power is wild and uncontained, a constant rage that seeks to unmake all things. He is
    the patron of hatred, destruction, decay, and madness. His followers are driven by an
    insatiable thirst for ruin and chaos, embodying the darkest aspects of these traits. Hatred
    fuels their every action, driving them to seek vengeance and sow discord wherever they tread.
    Destruction is their creed, as they revel in the annihilation of both physical structures and
    social order. Decay follows in their wake, with corruption seeping into the very fabric of the
    lands they touch. Madness, the most insidious of Ulat's gifts, infects the minds of his
    followers, twisting their perceptions and driving them to commit acts of unfathomable cruelty.

    In ancient times, Ulat sought to reshape the world through his vision of destruction and chaos
    and the Illyum became the focal point of his dark ambitions. To bend them to his will, Ulat
    conspired with the other Malor to lure some of the Illyum with promises of great power. The
    Malor subtly influenced them over thousands of years, whispering to them in the dark corners of
    their minds and slowly bringing out their baser instincts. The Malor nurtured their fears, fed
    their resentments, and stoked their hidden desires for power and dominance. Gradually, these
    once-pure beings succumbed to this insidious influence, and their forms and minds began to
    change. Once they , Ulat began to train them in the ways of war and destruction, bringing forth
    a love of chaos and violence that they had never known before. Thus, from the depths of their
    corrupted souls, the orcs were bornâ€”a race forged in darkness and rage, embodying Ulat's
    destructive nature.

    Under Ulat's guidance, the newly formed orcs were instilled with a fierce loyalty to their
    creator. He became their dark god, and they, his relentless warriors. Ulat imparted to them the
    strength and ferocity needed to survive and conquer, but also a deep-seated rage and desire for
    destruction. This rage made the orcs formidable opponents in battle, as they were driven by an
    insatiable need to prove their dominance and fulfill Ulat's will. The orcs, scattered across
    Edda since the end of the Great War, carry with them the legacy of their dark transformation,
    forever bound to the god who created them.

    To this day, orcish tribes across Edda continue to revere Ulat. Their shamans and war chiefs
    lead their people in rituals that honor their god, often involving blood sacrifices and acts of
    destruction. These ceremonies are meant to invoke Ulat's favor and draw upon his power, ensuring
    the orcs remain a formidable force. Their lore is filled with tales of Ulat's deeds and the
    punishments he metes out to those who displease him. The orcs believe that through acts of
    destruction and conquest, they honor Ulat and prove their worthiness. Young orcs are raised on
    these stories, learning from an early age that their destiny is to fight, conquer, and destroy,
    just as Ulat intended.

    During the Great War, Ulat played a pivotal and fearsome role. As the conflict between the
    forces of the Asier and the Malor reached its zenith, Ulat's insatiable desire for chaos and
    destruction found its perfect stage. He saw the war not merely as a battle for power but as an
    opportunity to reshape the very fabric of existence through ruin. Ulat's involvement in the war
    was marked by his relentless pursuit of devastation, driving his followers to acts of
    unparalleled brutality and violence.

    In the final days of the Great War, Ulat's fury reached its peak. As the tide began to turn
    against the Malor, Ulat unleashed his full power in a last, desperate bid for victory. The
    resulting cataclysms were felt across all of Edda, reshaping landscapes and leaving scars that
    would endure for centuries. The land of Ithra was razed in its entirety, its once lush and green
    landscape being reduced to a barren wasteland that has never recovered. Ultimately, however, the
    combined might of the Asier and their mortal allies proved too much even for the Maelstrom. With
    the Godsdeath, Ulat, along with the other deities, was banished from the mortal realm. His
    departure marked the end of the Great War, but the legacy of his devastation continues to shape
    the world to this day.
