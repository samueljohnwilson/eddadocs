    The Last Judge is revered not as the prime deity in any single culture, but he is respected and
    honored in many lands for his unwavering commitment to fairness and impartiality. His influence
    is particularly strong among those who value law and order, and his teachings are integral to
    the legal systems of various societies. Temples dedicated to Thal are often austere and solemn,
    reflecting his stern and disciplined nature. His priests, known as the Axioms, are highly

    Throughout history, Thal has played a crucial role in maintaining balance during times of
    turmoil. During the Great War, he remained outside the fray, advocating for reason and restraint
    amidst the chaos. His intervention was pivotal in negotiating ceasefires, and eventually truces,
    between warring factions; a great many innocent lives were spared due to his actions. Even after
    the Godsdeath, when the deities were banished from the mortal realm, Thal's principles continued
    to guide the civilizations of Edda. His teachings on law and order became the foundation for
    many legal systems, and his influence is still evident in the structured societies that flourish
    today.

    Thal inhabits Ethera, the metaplane that surrounds Edda and the other primary planes, Eya and
    Mora. Since the dawn of time, Thal has been tasked with maintaining the very structure of the
    planes and to constrain movement between them. In addition to enforcing the bounds of the
    planes, he tirelessly buttresses Ethera from the chaos introduced by his sister, Po, the
    Everstorm. While Po embodies the tumultuous and unpredictable forces of the universe, Thal
    stands as the bulwark of stability, ensuring that the balance between order and chaos is
    preserved. This cosmic responsibility highlights his commitment to the principles of law and
    reason, transcending the mortal realm to influence the very fabric of reality.

    Among Thal's most devoted followers are the Argenguard, an ancient order of mercenaries
    dedicated to upholding his principles. The Argenguard is renowned for their strict adherence to
    codes of conduct and their reputation for impartiality and justice in their dealings. They serve
    as elite enforcers and protectors, taking on contracts that align with Thal's teachings of law
    and reason. The Argenguard's members are highly disciplined, trained not only in combat but also
    in the philosophical doctrines of Thal, making them both formidable warriors and wise arbiters.

    Traveling jurists known as Arbiters are devoted followers of Thal, the Last Judge, and they
    traverse the realms of Edda to dispense justice and uphold the principles of law and order.
    These Arbiters are highly respected for their impartiality, wisdom, and unwavering dedication to
    Thal's teachings. Carrying the emblem of Thal, a balanced scale, they are called upon to resolve
    disputes, mediate conflicts, and ensure that justice is administered fairly in even the most
    remote and lawless regions. Their presence is a symbol of integrity and stability, and
    communities across Edda welcome them as trusted adjudicators. Trained extensively in legal
    doctrine, philosophy, and combat, Arbiters possess the skills necessary to navigate complex
    legal issues and, when needed, defend the innocent from tyranny and corruption. Their work not
    only enforces the rule of law but also promotes the values of reason and fairness that Thal
    embodies.

  <v-card-subtitle> The Sentinels </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    The form of the planes is governed by astral shards, enormous crystals created by Anoreth at the
    dawn of the universe. These ancient and powerful relics are the keystones of cosmic order, each
    shard resonating with the primal energy that maintains the stability and structure of the
    planes. The Sentinels are a race of metallic constructs imbued with life by Thal. Each is
    intricately designed, with etched runes and sigils that channel the power of order and
    stability.

    The sentinels wield the astral shards, using their immense power to maintain and manipulate the
    planes of existence. When a rift or disturbance occurs, a sentinel will use the power of the
    shards to restore balance and mend the fabric of reality. The shards themselves are not only
    tools but also sources of immense energy, capable of influencing the very essence of the cosmos.
    The Sentinels, through their deep connection to these shards, can channel this energy,
    performing feats matched only by the power of Anoreth.
