    However, since the Godsdeath, when Anoreth banished the Urdor from the mortal realm, Surad's
    divine influence has waned, his presence no longer evident in the affairs of mortals. With the
    rest of the Urdor, he was cast away from the mortal plane. Despite his absence, as the ages pass
    and civilizations rise and fall, Surad remains a figure of reverence and admiration.
