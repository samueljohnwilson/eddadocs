  <v-card-subtitle> OVERVIEW </v-card-subtitle>
  <v-card-text>
    <strong>Nogloth, the Ebon Blight</strong>, is a festering pestilence that spreads unseen through
    the world. He is the god of disease and decay, a force that lingers in the filth of the streets,
    the rot of the battlefield, and the fevered whispers of the dying. Where others see sickness as
    an affliction, Nogloth's followers know it as a truth of existence—an inescapable reality that
    humbles kings and beggars alike. To call upon Nogloth is to invite sickness, to embrace the
    frailty of flesh, and to acknowledge that in the end, all things succumb.

    To many, Nogloth is a force of terror, the harbinger of plague that brings civilizations to
    their knees. He is there in the first cough of a spreading illness, in the fever that takes hold
    without warning, in the silent dread of quarantine. His followers tell of the great pestilences
    of history, of cities emptied by his touch, of rulers begging for his favor only to be swallowed
    by the very sickness they sought to escape. Unlike other gods of destruction, Nogloth does not
    bring war or fire—his work is slow and insidious, a death that moves unseen through the air, the
    water, and the blood of the unknowing.

    Yet, there is a grim wisdom to his dominion. To Nogloth, disease is not merely a tool of
    suffering—it is the great equalizer, a force that does not heed wealth, power, or status. It is
    through illness that the mighty are brought low, that the arrogance of mortals is stripped away.
    His most devout followers see sickness as a divine reckoning, a reminder that all are mortal,
    all are vulnerable, and none can escape the decay that festers beneath the surface. Some whisper
    that those who accept his will, who do not resist the sickness, are granted glimpses of a deeper
    truth—a world where flesh is nothing and only spirit remains.

    The Plague of Akura was Nogloth's most insidious curse upon the world, a virulent pestilence
    that swept across the island of Rajapun during the Great War and has never truly abated. It
    began as a fever in the coastal villages, but within days, the afflicted were covered in weeping
    sores, their flesh blackening and sloughing away as their minds dissolved into fevered delirium.
    Those who did not perish outright soon turned into shambling husks, bodies still moving while
    their souls had long since withered. The plague spread relentlessly, carried by the winds and
    the teeming swarms of insects that hatched from the festering corpses left in its wake. No cure
    was ever found, and despite the best efforts of healers and priests, the land itself became
    tainted—every river, every tree, every breath of air steeped in the disease's corruption. Within
    months, Rajapun was abandoned, its once-thriving cities left to rot beneath a perpetual pall of
    sickness. To this day, no human who sets foot upon its shores survives for long, as the plague
    stirs to life at the presence of new victims. Only the dwarves can walk among the ruins without
    fear, though even they whisper of the shadows that still linger in the miasma, waiting for the
    return of their master.

    For as long as life endures, Nogloth will remain. He does not rage, nor does he gloat—he simply
    waits. His work is tireless, his reach inescapable. He is the whisper in the lungs, the rot in
    the blood, the shadow on the healer's face when they know that no remedy will come. His is the
    patience of plague, the certainty of corruption, and the cold, quiet promise that in time, all
    things must wither.

    The followers of Nogloth are a grim and secretive lot, moving unseen through the world like the
    very plagues they revere. His cultists see disease as a sacred instrument of divine will,
    spreading sickness in his name to purge the unworthy and hasten the natural decay of
    civilizations. Other followers include assassins who coat their blades in virulent toxins,
    delivering slow and agonizing deaths to their victims. These killers are often employed by
    secretive cabals or vengeful patrons, their work ensuring that even the mightiest rulers can be
    brought low with a single touch. In war, his disciples move unseen through enemy camps,
    poisoning wells, tainting food stores, and ensuring that even those untouched by steel fall to a
    fate far crueler. Their god does not demand blood spilled in battle—only the slow, creeping hand
    of death, delivered without mercy and without cure.

    Nogloth's plague demons, known as vireth, are grotesque horrors of filth and decay, shambling
    masses of rotting flesh and seething pestilence. Their bloated, diseased forms constantly ooze
    black bile, and their breath alone is enough to wither crops and sicken the strong. Wherever
    they tread, the ground festers, birthing swarms of vermin and clouds of choking miasma. The
    vireth do not fight with brute strength but with insidious inevitability, their claws festering
    with infections that no mortal healer can cure. Some take the form of leprous giants, their
    bodies riddled with gaping sores that spray noxious pus when wounded, while others are little
    more than writhing colonies of plague-ridden insects, shifting between humanoid and swarming
    forms as they descend upon their victims. When unleashed upon the mortal world, the vireth are
    not merely killers—they are living blights, walking pandemics that ensure suffering long after
    the battle is won.
